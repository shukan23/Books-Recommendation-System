But about a third of the plot is given over to the graves of Canadian servicemen, all of whom died in their late teens in the Winter of 1918/1919.  This was after the war had ended, and these boys died not at the hands of the enemy but from influenza.This excellent book homes in on the detective race to secure samples of the 1918 flu and identify the genetic code of the virus that caused it.  There are many other threads that the author could have followed, such as the appalling scale of human tragedy, the technical details of the virological study of the flu, and the shock value of our potential vulnerability to future outbreaks (and to diseases like SARS).  But Gina Kolata focuses on the scientific race to isolate and identify the virus, and this makes for a page-turning thriller.The book lacks structure, though, and becomes increasingly scrambled.  In tracing the parallel careers and scientific studies of the protagonists, Kolata attempts chronological jumps that fail.  Added to this, the editing of the book is sloppy and it contains howlers that are so illogical that I suspect them to have been introduced by a confused editor rather than put there by the author herself.Don't let this put you off.  Read this book.  It deals with an epidemic that has been ignored and downplayed to an astonishing degree, and it delivers pace, clear explanation and much that fascinates and excites.The 1918 flu is the poor relation in our dire human history of plagues, perhaps because it fell at a time when people were already bone-weary of loss and bad news.  This book redresses this balance, and I look forward to buying the next edition which will I expect repair some of the flaws in the first run and will certainly update this account of a rapidly-developing field."", 'Quite a readable book - a sort of scientific whodunnit - except we are left hanging. The book ends describing ongoing research so why not hold off publishing for a year or so until more information comes to light? I agree with the other reviewer about some cattiness regarding Kirsty Duncan - - was there any need to mention her looks or effect on other men in her team? So we are presented with a book that describes the 1918 Flu epidemic on the USA but pretty much ignores anywhere else! In the end a frustrating book.', 'Good condition.Very interesting read.Prompt delivery. What more can one ask?']";A national bestseller, the fast-paced and gripping account of the Great Flu Epidemic of 1918 from acclaimed science journalist Gina Kolata, now featuring a new epilogue about avian flu.When we think of plagues, we think of AIDS, Ebola, anthrax spores, and, of course, the Black Death. But in 1918 the Great Flu Epidemic killed an estimated forty million people virtually overnight. If such a plague returned today, taking a comparable percentage of the US population with it, 1.5 million Americans would die.

There's a lot in depth on historical accounts and lingusitics, as academically wide-ranging as the plains and mountains of central Asia, but expressed clearly for non-specialists. Her central theory of migrations of people from central Europe around 2000 BC is undoubtedly a simplification, and the book does have an old-fashioned feel to it.

S. Lewis, it\'s probably about his children\'s series ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" which is a colorful but straightforward fantasy tale about skipping between worlds and a lion god-king.But Lewis was in his best form when he wrote his Space Trilogy, a sprawling H. G. Wells-inspired story about a philologist traveling between worlds and encountering increasingly strange life-forms. Unlike most sci-fi stories, Lewis manages to do double-duty with his focus -- the first volume, ""Out of the Silent Plane,t"" is a solid, dreamy slice of imaginative science fiction with deep philosophical underpinnings.During a walking tour of England, philologist Dr. Ransom encounters an old despised schoolmate named Devine, who is busy trying to abduct a mentally handicapped teenager. Things take a nasty turn after Devine and his accomplice Weston drug Ransom, and load him onto a spaceship. Over the course of a month\'s interstellar travel, Ransom learns that they are traveling to the planet Malacandra (Mars) -- and worst, he\'s destined to be a human sacrifice.After landing on Malacandra, Ransom manages to escape, and quickly finds himself alone on a strange alien world. But fortunately there is life on this world. He soon is taken in by the otterlike hrossa, and learns that there are three sentient species on Malacandra: the peaceful poetry-loving hrossa, the workaholic pfifltriggi, and intelligent seroni. When a hross friend of Ransom\'s is killed by the murderous humans, he sets out to find the mysterious, powerful Oyarsa, who might be able to help him and stop his kidnappers.While it does have some interplanetary travel, ""Out of the Silent Planet"" feels less like your average space opera, and more like a novel by H. G. Wells (the spaceship journey) or Edgar Rice Burroughs (the detailed descriptions of the weirdness of Malacandra). Big fleshy plants, sentient otter-people, decreased gravity and petrified forests all give it the feeling of a truly alien world, as do the three species who populate it.In fact, the aliens are perhaps the most alien you can find in fiction -- three dissimilar species, who work together and have no problems like war, starvation, lies, power-lust or any of the other problems that human beings have. It\'s underscored by Lewis\'s contemplative stretches of ethical and philosophical dialogue, and the thought-provoking approach to ideas like consciousness, cruelty, love and so on. And he takes some razor-sharp jabs at ideas such as the ""white man\'s burden"" or that people who ""aren\'t useful"" to society (such as the handicapped) being disposable.Lewis\' writing has a dreamlike, somber quality that lends the story an eeriness that really permeates the entire story. And while Lewis\' Christian beliefs are on view, I wouldn\'t classify this as a religious book -- rather it\'s a science fiction tale as seen and perceived through the lens of a man of faith. For instance, the character of Oyarsa could be seen as an angelic figure, a nearly invisible shimmer of light and shadow that rules Malacandra, but others might just perceive him as an alien. Others might see him as both.Lewis reportedly based Ransom on his close friend, fantasy author/philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, and there\'s an obvious affection for his protagonist even as he\'s kidnapped, sent into space and becomes a ""stranger in a strange land."" He almost goes bonkers once or twice, but always makes it through with steadfast morality and intellect. On the other hand, Weston and Devine are the kind of person you have probably encountered in many comment sections -- they pay lip service to great advances and high ideals, but they are cold cruel men who value science and self above compassion and humanity. The opposite of the Malacandrians, in fact.""Out of the Silent Planet"" is a spellbinding, vivid and beautifully written piece of science fiction, with the intelligence and open-mindedness to see that the limits between the scientific and the spiritual don\'t have to exist. Off to Mars!']";The first novel in C.S. Lewis’s classic sci-fi trilogy which tells the adventure of Dr Ransom who is kidnapped and transported to MarsIn the first novel of C.S. Lewis's classic science fiction trilogy, Dr Ransom, a Cambridge academic, is abducted and taken on a spaceship to the red planet of Malacandra, which he knows as Mars. His captors are plotting to plunder the planet's treasures and plan to offer Ransom as a sacrifice to the creatures who live there. Ransom discovers he has come from the 'silent planet' – Earth – whose tragic story is known throughout the universe…

Almost all of the characters and places are real and it is a fascinating account of European history.

It's a warning from history"", ""There was either no editor employed here, or he shouldn't be employed again. At least a quarter of this should have been cut. As a result the rambling got the better of me and I had to donate it to cancer research."", 'As I read PRAGUE, I kept hearing whispers of Hemingway\'sTHE SUN ALSO RISES. The novel is about expatriates living and working in 1990s Budapest, just after the fall of Communism. The protagonist, journalist John Price, is in Budapest to reconcile with his brother Scott, who for some reason cannot stand the sight of him. John is enamored of embassy aide Emily Oliver, who is likewise disenchanted (She could be the Lady Brett of the piece if we continue the SUN ALSO RISES analogy). Charles Gabor, an American venture capitalist, is the villain (unless you count John Price as his own worst enemy) as he\'s in Budapest to make a name for himself by pillaging newly democratic Hungary of its marketable assets. All of these characters hang out at Café Gerbeaud where they play a game called ""Sincerity,"" especially appropriate since practically no one is this novel is sincere. We catch another whiff of SUN ALSO RISES when we learn that John Price is a virgin. A co-worker at his newspaper quickly divests him of the burden and before we know it Price is involved in a quirky sexual relationship with Nicky (no last name that I can remember), a photographer/artist and the most interesting character in the book. The plot revolves around Charles Gabor\'s efforts to loot Imri Horvath\'s publishing business with the help of some promotional articles written by John Price. Then there\'s the three-way relationship between Nicky, Emily, and John, the climax of which is the most entertaining part of the book. The characters don\'t measure up to SUN ALSO RISES, although John Price has to be one of the most clueless protagonists I\'ve ever encountered. The depressing tone is similar, however; we get the feeling that Phillips isn\'t so sure Budapest is better off under capitalism. I was also bothered by Phillips penchant for long sentences with intrusive parenthetical remarks, a stylistic irritant that I know Hemingway would choke on. I was also wondering why in the heck the book was called PRAGUE when the novel is set in Budapest. We don\'t get to see Prague until Price\'s train reaches the outskirts of the city at the end of the book. Maybe the choice was similar to the movie FARGO, where BRAINERD just didn\'t sound right.']";A novel of startling scope and ambition, Prague depicts an intentionally lost Lost Generation as it follows five American expats who come to Budapest in the early 1990s to seek their fortune. They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague have it better, but still they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making.  Read more

Whatever your views on religion, do please buy it - it's so very nourishing, so interesting, so clear; not a word wasted, every word takes you forward, makes you care about these women.Other reviewers tell the story: a Carmelite nun, enclosed for more than 25 years, begins to have astonishing visions in a life that has become arid.  But the visions may be due to a brain tumour inducing temporal lobe epilepsy, so what is she to do?  She is riven by doubt about the truth of her visions, and about her duty to the community to which she is bound by vow.

These have come to her after years of struggling with her vocation within this order and she feels she has finally found God.  She is taken ill and has to go to hospital for tests and is found to suffer a form of epilepsy, the symptoms of which are heightened awareness and visions.  So, she finds that her closeness to God was a physical, not a spiritual, manifestation and finds her faith once more is tested to the limit.  Having the minor surgery which will cure her of her illness also takes away these visions, these moments of spiritual awareness and she has to find a way back.Sometimes reading can be an uncomfortable experience and certain books are not easy, with prose which is difficult to grasp.  Presumably it is meant to do so.  Lying Awake is the polar opposite.

I'd been thinking about visiting the Hoover Dam and made a vague connection to this book so thought I would read it. It wasn't until I started to enter this review that I realised this book is a sequel so I will definitely buy the first book, although not reading it certainly isn't a limiter on enjoying this one.This book was published in 1993 and is 343 pages made up of 33 chapters.I'd read a lot of easy books prior to this so was keen to try something that was more memorable and may even challenge me.The novel strikes a balance between a deeply personal family story and a principle of US ethics which goes back to before the constitution. It considers whether a child can be taken from their roots and adopted - what is in the best interest of that individual child and is that at conflict with the overriding principle.The cultural issues are really interesting in this novel. I'm from the UK and knew something of the problems suffered by native Americans but had no idea the depth to which the effects impact on today's society.So much is unfamiliar to me in this story, even the names are difficult to understand but the explanations were perfectly pitched and I was engrossed in the dilemmas.Barbara Kingsolver brings the story to the level of an individual small child with her particular history and personality which encourages everyone to consider the more global view.As the book progresses the multiple levels of this novel are all given space to develop with many metaphors being used to explore understanding - the stars, the birds and the environment to mention just a few.Characters have links which are very gradually revealed. There is a huge amount of imagination used to create this plot and I can't help but sit back and admire it. The characters are just living their lives without understanding much of what is happening around them, putting the reader at and advantage as we can see the drama unfolding.Life moves as slowly as the seasons change with the plot being linked to the changes in the natural world, subtly different in the various locations.This is a gorgeous book and I loved the ending more than I have loved the ending of a book for a long time - perfectly written and completely satisfying."", ""This is a follow up to The Bean Trees which I loved, however after 142 pages I couldn't carry on, a couple of amusing lines, at the beginning, but felt Ms Kingsolver was just banging the same drum again and again, and it was giving me a headache.

So made the decision that life is too short and stopped reading"", 'This author writes beautifully. Her use of language brings the characters to life so much so that it is easy for the reader to engage with them and want a happy outcome.

The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and eventually comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. A classic piece filled with comedy, its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage and money during the Regency era in Great Britain.Mr Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but because his property is entailed it can only be passed from male heir to male heir. Consequently, Mr Bennet\'s family will be destitute upon his death. Because his wife also lacks an inheritance, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others upon his death, which is a motivation that drives the plot. Jane Austen\'s opening line--""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife""—is a sentence filled with irony and sets the tone for the book. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not simply for economic gain or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a good (i.e., wealthy) match.Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of ""most-loved books"" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature with over 20 million copies sold and has inspired many derivatives that abound in modern literature.[1][2] For more than a century, amateur and professional dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.[3] The 2005 film Pride & Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, is the most recent film adaptation that closely represents the book, with the 2016 action, comedy, and horror spin-off Pride and Prejudice and Zombies being the most recent Hollywood film adaptation.[4]387 people found this helpful.Review menu iconProfile imageMatthew Yim10 months agot is a truth universally acknowledged that some stories are capable of resisting the passage of time.In her most recognized work, Austen tells us the story of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Bennet, the second of five daughters of a rural family.

The family lives in a pleasant home called Loungborn, however they are all concerned for the day Mr. Bennet dies and Loungborn is inherited to Mr. Collins. Their only home would be gone, and they would be under the mercy of Mr. Collins, a distant cousin they hardly even know. Mrs. Bennet\'s plan to save the girls and herself is simple, have all the girls marry and then they’ll have their own comfortable homes and wealth. Now the story truly begins, when a wealthy bachelor named Mr. Charles Bingley moves into the estate Netherfield near Loungborn. Accompanied with him is his close friend Fizwillam Darcy and his sister Caroline Bingley. The Bennet’s almost immediately fall in love with Mr. Bingley and believe he will be the perfect husband for their oldest daughter Jane. While Jane and Mr. Bingley are enjoying each other\'s company, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are despising each other’s presence. But when Jane gets sick, Mr. Bingley mysteriously leaves Netherfield, a trip to Kent, a shocking letter with terrible truth, and a terrible threat that can ruin the Bennet\'s family reputation arises, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth discover that they have more in common than they thought. Jane Austen’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a gripping tale of love, marriage, and social status.  It can be universally acknowledged that Pride and Prejudice is a classic beloved novel. From the very beginning this book sucks you in. When I first received this book, I thought I would only sit down and read a chapter or two and then continue to go on with my day. After the first two chapters, I was intrigued and had to read another chapter, and then another, and then another. Before I knew it, I had read about six chapters and gained questionable looks from family members who could not understand why I was captivated by a simple book I had only started reading that morning. By the end of the day my mind was shifted from regular thoughts about daily chores and things to do the next day, and was focused on what would happen in the next chapter. The entire story is beautifully written, every event that happens results in the resolution.  Each event in the book is essential, there is no event that does not have a purpose in the story. Each character has a unique and different personality, which I appreciate. Elizabeth Bennet is very witty and intelligent, Mr. Bennet is sarcastic, Mrs. Bennet is excitable, and Jane Bennet is kindhearted. The character development is absolutely remarkable. The characters learn their mistakes, work hard to fix them (with time, practice, and a few mistakes here and there), and eventually fix their mistakes and flaws. Although some may say the story is “dull,” I however found the story quite gripping. Chapter 46 was so shocking to me, that I had to stop reading to comprehend the dreadful news.  After reading Pride and Prejudice I find myself recommending this book to all my friends and family who are searching for a next great read. If you are interested in reading a book about romance, Drama, and England, Pride and Prejudice will be perfect for you.

Reason:  superficial information on climate, soils, vineyards, age of vines, clones, styles of winemaking, etc.  In short, it is missing information of interest to readers with a serious interest in wines.  Haeger\'s book ""Pacific Pinot Noir"" is far far more useful for those interested in PN.  I bought this book in lieu of a Haeger update.  It was a waste of money, learned little or nothing.

The State is obliged to find you some form of service to attain that.So the truth is: Teachers can be citizens.  Emergency services can be citizens.  Even road sweeping and medical drugs testing can be routes to citizenship.There is no discrimination by way of race, religion, gender or physical ability.  If you want to become a citizen, the State will find some role for you to play.Military service is only one way, albeit usually the fastest.  The requirement is a single tour on the frontlines.  If you survive, and manage to retire, you can vote.Lawyers, businessmen and entertainers cannot.  They have no power to set tax laws and exemptions to benefit themselves.  Capitalism exists.  You can become rich and famous if you so choose.  But unless you put yourself at the service of the State, you will have less power than any voter.And those are the people screaming 'Fascist!'And now the second point.  Active military personnel are specifically forbidden from voting or standing for office.Think about what that means.It means that as long as you are a soldier, you cannot be a local councilman.  You cannot be a mayor.  A governor.  A judge.  You cannot be a senator or minister or President.Unless you have fought for your nation on the frontlines.  And retired from service, foregoing all military influence.A military dictatorship is a practical impossibility.  It cannot happen.I hope that clears up the most popular misconceptions about this book.The philosophy behind it is about personal discipline and responsibility.  Authority goes hand-in-hand with that responsibility.Oh, and there's some science fiction story going on in the background as well.  And that part I think was done very well in the film but even better in the animated series.Read the book.  Even if you are not a science fiction fan (and how can you not be?  This is the book that gave us *power armour*!) then skip the alternate chapters and just read the ones on philosophy.  They are very well reasoned.  I am a particular fan of Chapter 8.

Mr Lesser's wonderful range of voices comes as no real surprise for such a versatile actor, at present in roles as wide apart on the dramatic spectrum as Qyburn (Game of Thrones) and Reginald Bright (Endeavour).

Great descriptions, beautiful ideas. I want to go, see and think of your own.', 'great condition - prompt delivery', ""André Aciman could be seen as a masochistic writer. He constantly revisits scenes of distress and delight in order to spark his writing. In Alibis, his latest collection of essays, he confronts this central springboard of his work.I write about exile, remembrance, and the passage of time. I write - so it would seem - to recapture, to preserve and return to the past, though I might just as easily be writing to forget and put that past behind me.Throughout his recollections, Aciman weaves prose poems of great truth. The cities that drift across his vision are more alive on the page than the places themselves. So Aciman cannot help but weave his own delicious defeat. They are a film, he says, a version which cannot possibly be true. Alibis is filled with these precious moments, always just out of reach.For those who have read Aciman's novels - the heartstruck Call Me By Your Name and the cooler Eight White Nights - the themes in Alibis will be familiar. Memory, desire, the spirit of a place. Yet here Aciman strikes on something new: before, he appeared as a rather anonymous psychogeographer; now, he casts himself as the writer, alive to self-criticism and interrogation. The rhetorical nature of his writing therefore finds new levels of jeopardy.Aciman is at his strongest when the place he visits indicates the person he is. His writing about Rome is particularly redolent of the need to 'preserve and return to the past'. Having been exiled in the Italian capital as a boy, it retains a particular hold on the adult. Constantly shifting perspective away from the familiar, Aciman finds meaning in its otherwise meaningless rhythms. The real city exists in the shadows.No less beautiful are his commentaries on Tuscany, Paris, Barcelona and Venice. But these more touristic pieces cannot match the no-holds-barred 'this is the writer and the person I have become' clarity of the other essays. Although Aciman berates the personal memoir era in which we live, his writing is most alive when it confronts itself. And having travelled from Alexandria, through Italy to New York, personal geography allows constant access to that poetry and pain. Groping his way to the point of departure, Aciman admits that 'there is no home'. But books such as Alibis are so redolent of the human condition that you're left hoping that its author will continue his search regardless.

Mocondo begins its existance as a utopia built amid a swamp. At first – it’s a village that knows no death. Over time, Mocondo changes greatly as members of the Buendía family become entwined with broader events and as neocolonial activity comes to Mocondo in the form of a large US fruit company that establishes a plantation using Mocondo’s labor force. [If the title leads you to expect a great deal of solitude, you may be disappointed. The book begins ""in medias res"" with Col. Aureliano Buendía standing before a firing squad, and seldom is there a dull moment, thereafter. Even when the book isn’t in the midst of civil war or disputes between the fruit company and the workers, there are all kinds of strange happenings and fascinating psychology to consider. For example, retired Col. Aureliano Buendía spends his days making and then melting down little gold fish. The futility of this action should make it uninteresting, but the question of why he does it keeps one intrigued. If he sold the fish and made new one’s it would become just another boring job.]This book is known as one of those must-read masterpieces that don’t make it easy for the reader. That’s not to say it’s dull or written in a difficult style, which could be said to be the case for other books that fall into said category. The readability issues of ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" can largely be grouped under the intertwined categories of “time” and “characters.” (A third could be said to be the magical realist genre which places strange supernatural occurrences within an otherwise realistic setting and chain of events – events not unlike those that took place in real world Latin America. The genre doesn’t present a huge challenge, but it does insist on a more careful reading than would a book that is either pure realism or pure fantasy.)Because -- as the title suggests -- there’s a century covered, there are a lot of characters in this book. If having a lot of characters didn’t make it hard enough to follow, names are repeated from generation to generation. This isn’t the result of author laziness. One of the book’s main themes is how – no matter how the world changes – people get caught up in cycles of repeated mistakes and patterns of behavior. Repeating names establishes descendants as at once individuals and archetypes. Another challenge regarding time is that it’s not strictly chronological, but rather jumps around. At a broad level, there is a chronological flow reflecting Macondo’s life-cycle, but within this flow the story jumps around in time a lot. As with the name repetition, this too is likely done on purpose – in this case, in order to convey thoughts on time and memory. Memory is a fascinating issue as the reader sees the events that happen ultimately become mythologized, people no longer believe they happened as described but are rather tall-tales.One of the most engaging supernatural elements of the book revolves around writings of a traveling gypsy that are written out in Sanskrit and which sit around through the decades gathering dust. These writings aren’t meant to be translated until after one hundred years, and when one of the Aurelianos gets around to translating them, he discovers that they are prophesies that have told the whole story of Macondo, including what is to come, but by the time it is translated the future is already upon them.I found this book to be a pleasure. It’s not easy reading. One has to read with a level of conscientiousness that can be a labor to maintain. However, it’s worth it in the sense that it offers more food-for-thought than the average novel. There is a line of wisdom conveyed by this novel that has led to it being considered one of the most important novels in the history of literature. I’d highly recommend it for readers of literary fiction.', 'Nice but hard to read type book', 'The book is of such poor quality in terms of print, paper and binding.

The book is engaging and intense that reminiscenses of how history repeats itself with the collapse and creation of a new Macondo within a span of a century.

On one hand it treats Hester almost like a proto-feminist figure, undaunted and dignified in the face of public disgrace, one who earns her own living to raise her child and on the other, she is readily accepting of her own persecution.Similarly, Dimmesdale is torn between his emotional urges and his allegiance to a doctrine which denies him his humanity. Oppressed by the faith he clings on to for meaning and validation, he chooses private anguish over a public fall from grace quite consciously. In a way, he willingly remains a cog in the wheel of the Puritan machinery while subconsciously resenting the fact of his bondage. The author\'s treatment of Chillingworth is perhaps the most paradoxical. He is cast in the role of the Biblical snake, a decrepit looking man of intellect, but shown to be a strangely sympathetic cuckold at the same time who refrains from slut-shaming Hester and goes as far as admitting to his own failings as a husband, an astonishing and laudable character trait. I am not sure what was the point of linking natural intelligence with evil though.But let us decontextualize first. Because what good would it do to pan the tyranny of the Puritanical worldview in this day and age? And haven\'t re-envisioned Biblical scenarios already lost their sheen?Let us take the scarlet letter instead - the incriminating \'A\', a mark of woman\'s ultimate disgrace that Hester bears like a badge of honour in the last stretch, perhaps, having appropriated its connotative worth as a social censure and transmuted it into a part of her identity. Undoubtedly it is the most interesting thing about the novel, because the very weapon of social ostracism wielded against Hester contributes towards her maturation as a character and unwittingly bestows on her the capacity for unfettered thought and freedom of movement. By cementing her status as an outsider, it accords her the unique opportunity of spotting the limitations of a community imprisoned by its own conservatism and aids the process of her liberation and education.It might be a stretch to call the letter a symbol for female emancipation but the text is my guide and the author is dead (in the Barthesian sense) so I\'ll draw my own conclusions.Sample one of her observations as evidence -""Indeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood. Was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them?""My biggest quibble with the book is its insistence on viewing Dimmesdale as a co-equal sufferer as Hester, victim of his own mounting contrition and Chillingworth\'s insidious revenge. As if Dimmesdale suffers as much as the woman banished to the very margins of society wherein she is forced to raise a child on her own and endure the objectifying gaze of men and women silently pillorying her existence. It seems only Pearl, often referred to as a \'demon offspring\', a living embodiment of the repudiation of all doctrinal dogma, is quick to identify her father\'s moral hypocrisy -""What a strange, sad man is he!"" said the child, as if speaking partly to herself. ""In the dark nighttime he calls us to him, and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder! And in the deep forest, where only the old trees can hear, and the strip of sky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he kisses my forehead, too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it off! But, here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us not; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he, with his hand always over his heart!""Even the denouement is fashioned with the sole purpose of salvaging Dimmesdale\'s lost self esteem and paving the way for his atonement. His guilt-ridden conscience is the center of his universe, not the welfare of the woman he abandons to a fate of enduring countless indignities. And his decision to go out in a blaze of pseudo-heroic glory by finally confessing to his \'sin\' publicly is further evidence of his self-serving nature. If anything it proves to be his second act of traitorous desertion of Hester, in which he cruelly stamps out her last hope of beginning a new life elsewhere with the father of her child.Thus, I\'d remember him as a representative figure of the Puritan moral machinery which flounders in its attempts to maintain its infallibility in the face of sobering reality.Further, the elevation of Hester to a Christ-like symbol of suffering and self-sacrifice who graduates beyond the confines of the world of flesh to attain a near-mythical status is deeply problematic. It vitiates the fact of her growth as a woman of independent means whose very presence, albeit in the fringes of society, serves as an existential threat to the patriarchal Puritan set-up.The omniscient narrator\'s interjections serve as additional irritants especially because he feels like he has to expatiate on the symbolism of the letter, Chillingworth and Pearl time and again for the sake of the reader\'s benefit. We get it, Mr Hawthorne. You like insulting the reader\'s intelligence. Lastly, since the narrative mostly develops around the tension between conflicting ideologies it becomes a bit too involved with its own didacticism, often reducing its characters to mere stiff mouthpieces or symbols. It fails to create any dramatic suspense. As a result there\'s very little pleasure to be derived from reading.Tl;dr, this is probably not a feminist novel. But of all the things that stand out for me, the author\'s indirect indictment of slut-shaming remains the foremost. For obvious reasons.

Dealing with a new job, a wierdo who's only attracted to pregnant woman, an annoying doctor (the Crotch Whisperer!!), herds of strangers rubbing her belly, and the ever popular To-Do-List, Amy nearly drives herself and her husband nuts, while sending the reader into fits of laughter.I definitely recommend this book just as I did the first one. For anyone whose had a child, they'll know exactly what Amy's going through...as for the rest of us, we know what to look forward to (ugh!!). I can only hope Ms. Wolf gives us more adventures of Amy, Stephen, and now baby Stewart!!"", ""Laura Wolf is my favorite author.  There are only two books that have ever had me litterally laughing out loud with tears in my eyes: Diary of a Mad Bride, and now Diary of a Mad Mom-to-be.Diary of a Mad Mom-to-be takes Amy (now Stewart) through her next phase in life after marriage:  motherhood.The book takes the emotions, physical changes, fears, and hopes of a pregnant woman and presents them all in a light-hearted way that any woman, a mom or not, can relate to.If Laura Wolf writes another book, I'll be the first one to buy it.

Now Amy Thomas Stewart is a newlywed and a career woman, and becoming a mom is the last thing on her to-do list. So why is Amy obsessing about baby clothes and ogling pregnant women on the street? Suddenly Amy realizes the inconceivable: She wants a baby—even though she’s just lost her job, their apartment’s way too small, and she doesn’t have a clue as to

I guess it was the first psychological thriller I ever read and opened up for me a whole new perspective on the crime novel. I initially read this at a time when I was just becoming interested in human nature and what makes people tick and A Judgement in Stone had a pretty profound effect on me. It has been a book I have never forgotten and I wanted to see if, twenty-odd years later, it would still have the same impact on me.‘Eunice Parchman killed the Coverdale family because she could not read or write.’This first line blew me away when I first read A Judgement in Stone and blew me away again. You really can’t beat a killer first line and Rendell pretty much nails it here. This was the first opening line I fell in love with and it made me realise what an impact the initial line of a book can have. It raises so many questions – why would being unable to read and write result in the murder of a whole family? – and it perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the novel. This was the first time I had ever read a crime novel in which the perpetrator is known from the outset. From the very start we know who committed the crime, how the murders were carried out and when Eunice was arrested. This book is all about the why and it makes for a fascinating read as, let’s face it, who doesn’t want to know the motivations and thought processes behind those who commit murder?A Judgement in Stone is very much a character study. We get to know Eunice Parchman in a way that those around her don’t as we are privy to her secrets, thoughts and feelings. She is a character that has little to no redeeming features. I love a character I dislike and quite often I do find something in them with which I sympathise, however, I’m not sure I do in Eunice.Eunice isn’t the only dislikeable character. Her one and only friend Joan Smith is, quite frankly, unhinged and the Coverdale family are snobbish and assured of what they consider to be their elevated status. The only character I had any real positive feelings towards was Melinda Coverdale. This melting pot of difficult, disagreeable characters is one of the things that makes A Judgement in Stone such a great read for me.While the characters are central to the story, Rendell also uses the decisions we make and the actions we take as a central theme. There is the overriding sense of ‘if only’ throughout the book and it gets you questioning how much control we have over our own destiny. Every action each character takes results in a trajectory that will end in their eventual downfall.‘In that moment … an invisible thread lassoed each of them, bound them one to another, related them more closely than blood.’Rendell also fully considers the impact of illiteracy on the psyche and self-esteem of a person along with the views that others have of them. I remember how A Judgement in Stone made me re-think about my ability to read and I found myself considering this ability all over again while reading it for the second time. How we take reading for granted and use it without even thinking about it, how books and the written word open us up to experiences and emotions we have never had and how it can make us rounded individuals by aiding us in considering things from a different perspective. Rendell also made me really consider how those who are unable to read and write navigate a world in which the written word is so dominant;‘The advantage of being illiterate is that one achieves an excellent visual memory and almost total recall.’Rendell’s prose is considered and stunning and had me underlining so many sections of text. She has a real way with words as she manages to perfectly craft sentences that set the dark and catastrophic tone and you find yourself re-reading sentences more than once in order to fully appreciate their beauty and meaning. First published in 1977, there are some expressions and words that are quite shocking and offensive to our modern sensibilities but they clearly give a feel for the time and the less politically correct world we live in.A Judgement in Stone is one hell of a book and I enjoyed it as much, years later, the second time around. It stands the test of time and, in my very humble opinion, is a classic. If you enjoy psychological thrillers and haven’t read this book get it on your bookshelf as soon as possible.', ""The story itself is fairly short only 220 pages long with relatively short chapters designed to keep the pages turning at a fast rate.Ruth Rendall starts this book with the words 'Eunice Parchman killed the Coverdale family because she could not read or write.' giving the reader the murderer, the victims and the motive straight away, but this book kept me gripped as the story of Eunices early life, her work for the Coverdales and her friendship with Joan Smith, a zealot and wife of the village postmaster.Ruth Rendall gives us sharp observations about not only Eunice but the Coverdale family headed by George, a pompous managing director and his younger wife Jaqueline, who prefers meeting with friends and having her hair done, to keeping on top of the cleaning at the manor house they lived in Lowfield Hall.This is a stand alone story, not one of the Wexford mysteries and show cases her psychologically based stories very convincingly. The setting of a small village in England in the early 70's fuelled by gossip in the local shop and the pub, The Blue Boar, all add to the bewiderment when the family is slayed.""]";Four members of the Coverdale family - George, Jacqueline, Melinda and Giles - died in the space of fifteen minutes on the 14th February, St Valentine's Day. Eunice Parchman, the illiterate housekeeper, shot them down on a Sunday evening while they were watching opera on television. Two weeks later she was arrested for the crime. But the tragedy neither began nor ended there.  Read more

Here\'s the reason:One thing I love about The Sandman is the variety of artists and styles used in the series. I was intrigued to look at what a Sandman story would look like if done in the Manga / superdeformed style, and even though this is not a Neil Gaiman original story, it is based upon Season of Mists, so does have a grounding of, dare I call it, osmotic authenticity. I had a feeling that there was probably something good or at least fun here, and that anyone not familiar with the Manga world (okay, I\'m not an expert, but I\'ve read ""Death Note"") might totally misinterpret it merely by not knowing the `rules\'.I think many people probably instantly hated this book because they were looking at it in completely the wrong way. The marketing of this as a Death story doesn\'t help that. When I started reading it, I very quickly realised that if you take the title on face value - ""Death: At Death\'s Door"" - you\'ll start telling yourself that `Death wouldn\'t act like this\'. But read onwards, and you come to realise that this isn\'t just a story of Death through a Manga lens, it is a story featuring Death as seen by Delirium, who is very much involved with the story. Read this book as ""Delirium: At Death\'s Door"", viewing it as her recollection of what happened, and you\'ll realise that this is a lot closer to being an authentic Sandman story than many might at first assume.That aside, and commenting just on the story, I enjoyed it a lot. It\'s great fun, though arguably the silliness goes on for a little too long, and seeing key scenes from Season Of Mists told in a different way was just as much fun as reading a new story. I have to thank those who gave it negative reviews as, ironically, if the reviews had been overwhelmingly positive I would not have bought it, telling myself that I already had enough with the Absolute editions, Endless Nights and Dream Hunters, without starting on any of the spin-offs that Neil Gaiman didn\'t directly have a hand in. As Desire would smirk to hear me say, I\'m glad I crossed that threshold.', ""This volume runs concurrent with\xa0\nThe Sandman Vol. 4: Season of Mists (New Edition)\n\xa0and contains more spoilers for that book than actual plot of its own.  If you read this first you'll regret it; a lot.  It contains cutesy manga versions of the Endless.  The best of these, and the one that would be hard to fail at, is Delirium.  The kooky young muddled-up persona is perfect for this kind of story.  She needs her own series, and an animation.Jill Thompson's lines are wonderful, and her understanding of the regular/chibi forms at the correct times can't be faulted.  It feels like Sandman fan-fic written by someone that has got the blessing of the creator.  The humour relies on the fish out of water scenario, which is fine for this kind of thing.  What isn't fine is the characterisation, and unless you embrace that side of it you'll put the book down unfinished.  Besides Delirium, the other main characters are nothing like their Gaiman penned versions (except when they're using his words).  It doesn't really go anywhere structurally, there is no progression of character but it's a fun aside to the main series.  For a younger reader it may hold the attention more."", 'Bought as a gift']";"Written by Jill Thompson; Art and Cover by Thompson A manga digest, printed in black, white, and gray tones, featuring appearances by Sandman and all his siblings.

There’s obviously this lingering feeling of satisfaction of having read it, but to be honest I don’t know whether I’ve enjoyed reading it or is it the other way round. I remember times, when I found it extremely difficult to relate with the characters of the book, and at others I could almost imagine myself being in their shoes. Although being from the same age group as that of the characters mentioned in the book, at times their emotions and their actions seemed foreign to me. The author is exceptionally unorthodox for having set up a backdrop and characters of the rebellious kind, in the era of the sixties. It certainly does give a vivid picture of Tokyo in the sixties. Naoko who was romantically involved with Toru, felt relatable at times. There were times, when the complications of Naoko’s Thoughts were so beautifully penned by the author, that I almost felt her pain. But, at the same time there were moments when Naoko seemed as distant to me, as did Toru. I would say the most flabbergasting character of the book is Midori. That character pulls off things which at times May become unfathomable to the human mind-and honestly, I tried hard to imagine that what Murakami must’ve had in mind while building up this character of Midori, but I failed miserably. She’s a rebel for certain, having born to middle class parents who wanted her to fulfill their unfulfilled aspirations ( we feel her right!! Our story is the same), and hence she has grievances against this society and her parents too which she expresses by getting things done perfectly, without leaving any scope for complaining. But there are times when her behaviour mat seem disturbing to the reader, but we cant really complain, because she seems to be the only character in the book, who is not terminally depressed inspite of having an ailing father to look after and her mother’s death to deal with. The protagonist may seem lust- driven to a few (for me he certainly was), or to be fair to the author, maybe had I been through what he had been through, i would’ve liked to fill that void using physical relationships without any commitments — or , would I ?! As I already wrote, it is confusing to determine. But what the book deftly does, is it blurs the lines between right and wrong and makes everything situational. It has a lot of philosophy in it, or atleast I felt so after reading it, it did certainly make an impact on me and I ended up thinking about it and the characters for days after k had finished reading it, but I realised that after a point in the story, there was a certain feeling of urgency within me to complete the book ASAP , and I don’t really know why that happened!!I would like to conclude by saying that, its definitely worth a read once, but I don’t whether you would want to read it for a second time. Murakami has a beautiful yet simple way of narration, and when I finished reading I was filled with a sweet sadness, something similar to what we feel while bidding goodbye to an old friend.'];"Read the haunting love story that turned Murakami into a literary superstar. When he hears her favourite Beatles song, Toru Watanabe recalls his first love Naoko, the girlfriend of his best friend Kizuki. Immediately he is transported back almost twenty years to his student days in Tokyo, adrift in a world of uneasy friendships, casual sex, passion, loss and desire - to a time when an impetuous young woman called Midori marches into his life and he has to choose between the future and the past.

Whilst there are many sections to praise, of particular note are the dreams that Felicia has where she shows the torment running through her.Towards the end I felt that the confusion of Mr Hildred became overpowering and took away slightly from Felicia's fate but I could not put it down, finding that even 15 pages from the end I still had no idea what was going to happen and actually wasn't really sure what had happened anyway.

Not only are the characters real, breathing people that leap off the page, but the town they live in is a character too.What particularly struck me about this novel in stories was how each ""view"" over the years built on the previous.  It was a clever way of showing us how America itself has changed as the lives of the people populating the town evolve too.  I would compare this book to Lee Smith\'s ORAL HISTORY, where each story mirrored the changes in American society.  As our storytelling methods changed, so did the people who told the stories.Similarly as WORLD OF PIES begins in pre-Vietnam smalltown Texas, then carries us through the war (I was particularly moved by the main character\'s relationship with her cousin who comes home a broken version of the boy she idolized), we see the town change too.A beautiful, moving novel that I would put on a list of all-time favorites.', ""This reads like a first effort although I don't know if it is.

Allows readers to share the trials and triumphs in the combat zone.', ""I enjoyed this page-turner of a book.  Some might think that a radioman's account of the early part of SEAWOLF's wartime exploits might make for a risky buy.  But the book works very well on a number of levels.  First, there's much to like about the account of the trivia of submarine life.  Second, many accounts of depth-chargings exist but few are as good as this.  Third, the radiomen on this submarine doubled as sonar operators when the boat was submerged.  This ensures that the action narrative is firmly focused on what the commanding officer and his attack team were doing.  The one weakness is that the boat's appreciation of how much damage it was doing to the enemy is awry in places and there are no post-publication notes.  Who might enjoy this tale?  Any students of the USN's operations in the aftermath of the attacks on Pearl Harbour and the Philippines.  Anyone wanting to command a submarine one day.  (SEAWOLF's Navy Cross-winning CO was a fine example of a good skipper.)  And anyone wanting to learn more about the use of sonar in submarine attacks.  Devoid of illustration, the book works well on Kindle - and at the 99p price-point, the soft-copy is compelling value for money.  One final point: I would recommend that anyone purchasing this book fights the natural temptation to research the SEAWOLF's career before they finish reading the story."", 'Overall this is a mildly interesting account of the author’s time at sea. I’ve read a number of submarine accounts and what this book rather fails to do is really give you a sense of the terror and tedium of submarine life that others give. The dialogue within the narrative is rather pithy and doesn’t really add weight for me to the first hand account like it’s meant to.Although the account does tell if Seawolf’s sinkings, it doesn’t give enough context to see why it’s a great achievement.Overall, quite a straight forward account.One word of warning; the languished in the book hasn’t been modernised at all, so the Japanese are referred to as “Japs” or “Nips”, among other things, which reading today is quite offensive. Of course I accept that at the time this was no doubt acceptable at a time of war, but jarring to me to read now. Thankfully it’s a short book.']";U.S.S.

Without being an imposing self-help book, this book becomes the guiding light which so many of us lack. Well, what can I say about a book that most of us would wish was our story, one which we wish could have happened to us… But then, I can give my two cents anyway, right? So, tell me, how many of you can say you have a happy life, or are content with what you have? I know am not going to get many positives out of this question, but I still would like to know (you can answer in the comments if you want) As a young girl, I have always seen my father working day in and day out to provide us with the best lifestyle, clothes, food, keeping a shelter over our heads, those impromptu demands, holidays, pocket money...the list is endless, same as yours. It wasn’t a very good time, setting up in an entirely different city after a successful business in another is very difficult, I can say that first hand. So, as it happened, I was not a very compassionate and considerate child. Tantrums and anger were my other names. Growing up, I never realized what my parents had sacrificed for me and my sister, which I do now. I was never thankful, wanted bigger, better and costlier things. Until recently, I was of the same opinion as earlier. Things changed when I got into my first relationship, like a lot of other people of my generation, my husband. It was with him that I started to understand my parents and the meaning of life.Having shared 3 years of my life with the amazing man that my husband is, I have become wiser than I ever had been. He has taught me that the world is a nice place even if it hasn’t treated me well. There are many who have and many who will. So stop criticizing, and try to look for goodness in everyone. Self-pity is the worst of all the pity. It makes one lose confidence and subsequently, all happiness drains away. It is okay to cry for ourselves, but more important to buck up, and move on. Everyone has regrets, I have even if you don’t. It is not a means to get negative, it is, in fact, a means to do things better so as to not regret again. One thing that I haven’t had a chance to discuss with anyone, is death. You are too young to talk about such things, they would say. But I know, death doesn’t see the age, it just seeks. Maybe, someday, decades later I will have my husband talk to me on death, and if I remember this review by then, I’ll come back and edit. I am what I am because of my family. No, they don’t define me, rather they have made me the person I am today. My parents helped shape my character, teaching me that being a girl doesn’t mean you have to be weak and my husband further solidified this notion by letting me do anything I want, guiding me along the way. And yes, my little girl, she is bringing out the very in best me. My emotions have become profound. I know not to feel ashamed if I shed a tear watching some scene in a video or imagining my little girl all grown up. I know how to accept that others have emotions too, and if I am unable to understand them, I should at least be empathetic. Over the years, I’ve grown. Emotionally, mentally and physically. We all do. What we all don’t do is accept it, especially the physical part. The growth to the peak and then, the slow descent, aging. Oh, where did I lose my youth, this phrase makes one forget the truth. Acceptance of wrinkles, or lines, of shriveled skin, of receding hairline, of a bulging belly, of crows feet, of bad eyesight, of deteriorating health, of dwindling grip, is not at all easy. But, it must be done, and only doing so gracefully will make it easier. Yes, money can these days help a lot in the process, but it can’t stop the process. Money can’t bring back the youth, but it can make the old age better. Money is not happiness, but it is important for happiness. My thoughts may differ here, then again, whose won’t?Do you believe your family and friends will love you even when you are gone? I believe it because I know it. Love is something that never fades, it just passes. What I received as love from my parents will reflect on how I love my daughter. My daughter has never seen my grandfather and I have never seen my grandmother, but I will surely tell her stories of him, the way my father tells us stories of his mother, which makes me miss, and love my grandmother, long long after she has gone. I also know that my husband would love me, long long after I am gone. When we married, we weren’t in love. Like with most of the arranged marriages, we were practically strangers thrown together to spend our lives. It wasn’t until the first anniversary that we fell in love, realized the importance of each other and committed ourselves fully into our marriage. We were wedded first, married later, the way our culture demands. Who is this culture by the way? A person? A group? What is it? It was sheer luck that we fell in love, what if we hadn’t? Would our culture have let us part ways? The main aim of the culture should be let people live their lives happily instead of forcing them to fake their happiness just for the sake of culture! I believe forgiveness is the key here, for those who have been wronged, forgive and move on. It will not affect anyone else but you alone, and the peace thereafter is more important than burning in anger.There are no perfections in life, only in theory. A day can be perfect to you but not to me. Same goes for a person, or a thing or anything else for that matter. Only our way of perception can bring about perfection. When the time comes for me to leave my physical body behind, I wish I have enough time to say my goodbyes, which by the way won’t be enough ever, but it will prepare me and my dear ones for the imminent death that lays ahead.Life is meant to live, not spend. Have a happy life everyone!', ""I have learned so many lessons related to the true meaning of life ,that I never imagined.now I have made a promise to myself that no matter whatever happens in my life, I will be knowing that it's never too late.."", 'Wonderful book. Must read for everyone to understand how to go about life. Very positive and very motivating. Very useful for gifting']";Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months

It was written earlier and has a broader focus.  Generally quite pleasant reads.The general concept is still problematic.  An anthology of writing about a place, where the selections are 10 paperback pages or so by fine writers with great stylistic differences, can easily devolve into ""100 Polaroids by famous photographers about Italy\'...saying more about the art of photography than anything about Italy.Two specific conceptual problems.  First, ten pages of a prose selection, even one from a book about Italy, either gives a few ""wow look at that"" by a celebrity writer or one deeper insight that, out of context, doesn\'t really sing.  The poetry selections work much better, because most are originally short self-contained works.  The second problem is the stylistic differences between the authors get in the way of the message.  By the time we get over the whiplash of going from a short Mary McCarthy excerpt to a short Herman Melville excerpt, we\'ve forgotten the point.Fundamentally, you can\'t say much meaningful in prose in ten pages about a topic such as Italy.  A selection of pithy quotes or the original long form is much better.  Too much like making it across the Grand Canyon in two jumps.There is still the issue of writings about Italy in particular, vs. writings about an old country, or any southern European country, or any relatively poor first-world country or any agrarian region of any country.  Over-privileged over-urbanized first-world authors (they\'ve already made it if they are publishing their travels in Italy) tend to veer into ""Look dear, a quaint farmer with a quaint basket beside a quaint olive tree, isn\'t Tuscany charming (we in our clique still think that, right?) but aren\'t they noisy"" territory.  An honest impression, but speaking more to the limited world view of the author and their assumed audience than to any insight about Italy.Saying all that, this is the sort of quick-pick-me-up-and-put-me-down book that won\'t rot your brain.  And you will be exposed to a group of fine writers on a topic you probably have some incipient interest in.  Nice cover on the Vintage paperback version.', 'I packed this book on a recent tour of Italy, and read most of it on the beach near Paestum towards the end of our two-week vacation. The variety and scope of the selections included in this anthology matched my (characteristically) eclectic itinerary well (Lucca, Padua, Venice, Assisi, Salerno), and the book\'s size and weight is appropriate to include with the luggage.If, like me, you never quite know what you are going to want to read once you are actually in Italy, this book is not a bad solution to the problem.In some ways I wish I had read the anthology before going, and packed the entire texts from a few of the original sources instead.  I particularly enjoyed the selections from Matthew Spender\'s book ""Within Tuscany, Reflections on a Time and Place"" and, more surprisingly, Susan Sontag\'s novel ""The Volcano Lover"". It\'s not clear however if something like ""The Volcano Lover"" would have been nearly so captivating if I hadn\'t first started reading it near Vesuvius.  I know, for example, that Shelley\'s poem ""Stanza\'s Written in Dejection, Near Naples"" probably wouldn\'t have grabbed me if I hadn\'t read it after a long lunch on a perfect Summer day, near Naples.Why only 4 stars?  The chapters are ordered alphabetically by author\'s last name, which confused me at first (I\'m kind of dumb) and struck me as a bit of a cop-out.  It was also confusing trying to figure out when the selections were originally written, which is particularly annoying when reading a non-fiction piece.', 'When traveling to Italy, it is so important not to travel as the proverbial armchair traveler.  Know the subject, know the place, to better know the self.  Italy in mind provides so much more than racing through the spoils that are part of the Vatican Museum only to gaze upon the ceiling of the chapel Sistine.  The various authors in this book provide an often overlooked perspective when heading off to the old country.']";Comprised of short stories, novel excerpts, essays, poetry journals and letters, this work will delight anyone who loves Italy or great travel writing. Pieces include Barbara Grizzuti Harrison marveling at baroque Sicilian confections, Mary McCarthy celebrating Venice's threadbare dignity, and Henry James's Isabel Archer succumbing to the treacherous antiquities of Florence.

Re-reading them yet again, this time on Kindle, confirms that she was one of the most insightful writers ever.That sounds a bit sycophantic, but whenever I read her books, I can instantly visualise the scene. She doesn't describe the physical characteristics of the characters unless it is essential - Lessa is small, Menolly is tall and that's as much description is needed. The genius is in the way she somehow lets your imagination bring the scene to life by describing the actions and gestures of the characters.The earlier books are a bit naiive, and the entire mechanism of the Thread being flung from a rogue moon to Pern has no scientific grounding. It doesn't matter. These are books about people.Very, very good books, too. Menolly is believable (she's based on a real person), her apparently hopeless situation is one which many will recognise. The same can be said of Robinton. We don't know what he looks like, but we all know someone like him. Maybe that's McCaffrey's genius. We put our own faces on the characters, drawing them from our own lives, perhaps even unconsciously.This is a book that has been reviewed many, many times, so I'm not going to go over it once more.It love it, and I doubt I will ever read anything that moves me like the story of Menolly, Piemur, Robinton and Sebell.If you are new to McCaffrey, what have you been doing?! Buy all Anne's books (up to where her son began co-writing) and read them."", ""I've been wanting to get into the Dragonriders of Pern series for quite some time, and tried on many occasions, starting various books. This is one of the reasons I've started in the 'wrong' place. Given the fact there was definitely some lore I felt I was missing which was probably given in the earlier three books. But saying that none of what I didn't know spoiled my enjoyment of this book. I got totally emersed in the world of Pern and look forward to returning."", ""This was a truly enjoyable and enchanting story following Menolly, a young girl who has dreams of becoming a harper.Her father and mother, the hold master and mistress, however, have the misguided belief that a girl hasn't any right to such a position and attempt to stop Menolly, though not in a malicious way, from achieving her dream.Menolly is wonderfully written and I found myself rooting for her from the start.""]";Fifteen-year-old Menolly allies with magnificent dragons in the first book in the Harper Hall trilogy, set within science fiction legend Anne McCaffrey’s beloved and bestselling Dragonriders of Pern series.For centuries, the world of Pern has faced a destructive force known as Thread. But the number of magnificent dragons who have protected this world and the men and women who ride them are dwindling. As fewer dragons ride the winds and destruction falls from the sky, Menolly has only one dream: to sing, play, and weave the music that comes to her so easily—she wishes to become a Harper.

It still holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the series that really got me stuck into scifi and fantasy fiction.This book however is probably the weakest of the lot - and is also the last book in the series.It really felt like there was a lot of further world building here - but no actual story of worth. The little plot contained being very much repetitive and lacking.Which is a shame, because this is one of my favourite Anne McCaffrey series.The book is definitely a product of it\'s time (when it was written) and although I love it so much - would definitely NOT reccomend it to new and younger readers, unless they are looking to deliberately explore older writing. Definitely a book for fans of Anne Mccaffrey only.(There is also the ""questionable"" decision to pair up a gay guy with a straight girl and \'Dream Away the Gay!\')Note: Amazon insists this series has 6 books - it does not, it only has 5. (But there is a prequel trilogy available - To Ride Pegasus, Pegasus In Flight and Pegasus In Space)', 'Of all Anne McCaffrey\'s books, the ""Talent"" ones (starting with Pegasus..) competed with the Pern Trilogy, Dragonflight et al, for my favourites, BUT her quality seems to be fluctuating wildly these days.The Talent series is comparable to the Pern series. I re-read The White Dragon, and immediately followed that with Renegades of Pern, which was ghastly - turgid verbosity. I was never able to shake off the image of Anne sat in front of her PC writing Renegades with a big black cloud of ""contractually obligated to churn out X Pern a year"" depression over her head. Then she wrote ""all the weyrs"" and the magic was back (Skies was ok too, and I liked Todd McCaffrey\'s sole Pernese effort).The same thing happened with TT&TH series. Part of the problem is with McCaffrey\'s proofreader, who wants firing. Leaving aside the blooper that gave us an incestuous relationship by referring to Afra Lyon as Damia\'s brother not husband, there was also that in The Rowan which gave Rowan parents with entirely different names and occupations barely 10 pages apart. But I did enjoy The Rowan, and Damia, though I felt she got some unfair stick - Rowan and Jeff Raven were simply too career obsessed and selfish to have children at that time and poor Damia was merely unfortunate enough to be a normal baby after they lucked out with 2 ""starkids"" in Jeran and Cera. (Given Our Author is a mother of 3, one wonders about this portrayal of Damia as a ""problem"" when she was a perfectly ordinary baby).I also enjoyed Damia\'s Children and Lyon\'s Pride to a certain extent, though again the villain(s) was weak - Sedalla nearly kills Isthian yet gets taken out easily. Likewise when Rojer\'s Mrdini are murdered by the rogue General, he teleports himself into hiding in anguish, and yet not one of his powerful family of telepaths notices? Or hears his grief? Sorry, but if I were Laria/Thian/Zara and heard my brother mentally scream in anguish I\'d have been on that spaceship kicking Dini posterior if I had to teleport across the known galaxy without any ""gestalt"" backup to do it. of course, the biggest flaw was Dano Kincaid, a relentlessly homosexual politically correct character, who suddenly does a 180 into Laria\'s lover. Again, I couldn\'t shake the image of Anne getting to the last chapter and suddenly realising she needed a Love Interest and not being bothered to rewrite the novel properly as she should.The Tower and The Hive, which I was really looking forward to, has exactly the same problems. Its about the Talents, but, like the most recent ""Pegasus"" novel, it reads in some places like a High School ""dumbed down"" textbook on science - and it\'s not really a coherent narrative, more an anthology/series of vignettes as if McCaffrey had a list of ""plot threads"" she needed to tie up to finish the series that she just ticked off the list once she\'d written a few pages for each. Afra Lyon, who had to leave Capella and his gentle sister Goswina behind because he realised their ""Methody"" ways were too restrictive, is in TH&TH an interfering Methody father who puts up no resistance to Jeff Raven, who in TH&TH is, bluntly, a sexist bully wanting to turn his children into breeding cattle - a complete reversal of character from the original young, handsome rebel. The Rowan, the tough, sarcastic heroine of the first two books who would never win any mother of the year prizes (remember, she insensitively farmed out her 5 children, Jeran, Cera, Damia, Larak and Ezro onto her mother-in-law Isthia Raven, who had recently lost her husband Josh, several of her 12 children and grandchildren in the first ever Hiver attack) is now a submissive, adoring matron to Jeff\'s dynastic-ambition obsessed boor.All 8 of the Lyon kids, plus their cousins (Jeran, Cera and Ezro having churned out dozens of offspring to go with murdered Larak\'s posthumous son), are slavishly happy to kowtow to Jeff Raven\'s baby conveyor belt plan to totally dominate Talents forever (and what happened to the powerful Reidinger family?).The siblings also appear to have none of the normal sibling love for each other or simple pleasure in being with each other - Thian is particularly cold and humourless as the first Naval Prime. The chief villain fades away and then turns white hat, Dano Kincaid gives Laria an insipid, ""I\'ll love you as much as my sexuality allows"", at which point any female with the slightest hint of spine would have given him the heave, preferably helped by a sharp-toed stilletto shoe to the ass\'s ass.To be honest, given the character reversals and changes, I have to wonder whether this novel was written by Anne McCaffrey at all or whether it was knocked up to meet a contractual obligation by her son Todd who contented himself with getting the ""cliff notes"" from mum and winged it from there.Given all the cash Ms McCaffrey had made from her writing, if she really can\'t find that spark that gave us the gems that are The Rowan and The White Dragon, then I would suggest it be better if she retired. Either that or write Number 6 in the Talent series, in which: Laria gets a backbone and dumps Dano when she meets (a possibly alien?) real male with some testosterone, Rojer teaches his brother Thian and his family about showing affection and care for your siblings (possibly by attempting suicide when nobody realises he\'s depressed?) Rowan gets her personality back, Jeff Raven apologises for turning sexist, and one of the Raven kids decides against becoming a baby making machine. Since I\'m a writer whose hobby is fan-fiction writing, I may have to fix all the above mistakes myself, but why should I have to? I suggest Ms McCaffrey puts her imagination and her writing on a strict diet of David Eddings and Lois McMaster Bujold, with an exercise regime of Christine Feehan and Suzanne Brockmann and Chris Stasheff before she writes her next book, because quite frankly at the moment her imagination is obviously a McFood munching couch potato grown flabby and out of condition from long-term commercial success which means it hasn\'t had to make an effort.', ""Loved this series by Anne McCaffrey the first time round 40 years ago they haven't lost their wonder and fascination""]";For generations, the descendants of the powerful telepath known as the Rowan have used their various talents to help mankind - some are telepaths, others can teleport through space, others are empathic healers. The clan has grown powerful. They have led Earth to ally itself with the alien Mrdini, and together the two races have held back the predatory Hivers, a deadly insectoid species that kills all life it finds.Like all powerful families, the Rowan clan has also made enemies.

Stunningly inventive language tinged with Robbins' signature style of psychedelic surrealism, his similes and metaphors are consistently mind-bending, exotic, erotic and witty. But, for me,  there is also an aching, heartfelt quality to this writing which reveals Robbins' deep love for this particular landscape with its lush, dark forest greens and charmingly perpetual, drizzly rain. And, of course, MUSHROOMS! Plenty of mushrooms!By concentrating the story to one principal location with four main characters, this novel has a marvellously focused, almost theatrical edge, which helps Robbins build memorable characters with convincing back stories. There's beautifully organic development as Amanda and John Paul establish their new home by the highway, setting up their insect zoo and diner attracting charmingly goofy oddballs by the dozen. The novel's remarkable conclusion also lives up to the bracing subtitles: 'An Apocalyptic Entertainment!' and 'A Metaphysical Suspense!'For me, this astonishingly accomplished debut novel easily rates as highly as 'Skinny Legs & All' and 'Jitterbug Perfume'.

More Die of HeartbreakBellow, Saul. More Die of HeartbreakDer Titel dieser 1987 erschienen Novelle will wohl sagen, die meisten Menschen sterben nicht an diversen Erkrankungen, sondern an gebrochenem Herzen. Ein ungewöhnlicher Roman. Sehr lang, vielleicht sogar (angenehm) langatmig. Es geht um zwei Personen.In erster Linie um einen russischen Juden, der im kalten, kapitalistischen, egomanen Chicago lebt und sich einzig und allein Pflanzen widmet. Er ist Botaniker mit Weltruf, eine Kapazität auf seinem Gebiet, überall auf der Welt zu Vorlesungen willkommen. Er forscht unter anderem über Lichen, das sind flechtenartige Gebilde, die u.a. in der Arktis und Antarktis zu finden sind. 90 % ihrer Lebenszeit sind sie zu Eis gefroren und sozusagen im tiefen Schlaf, eigentlich tot. Bei etwas Wärme, sprich Sonnenlicht, wachen sie auf und wachsen weiter bis zum nächsten Kälteschlaf usw. Sie sind eigentlich unsterblich. Der Wissenschaftler ist aus Russland in die USA ausgewandert und lebt hier nun in seiner universitären Welt, also auf einer akademischen Insel mit ausreichendem Gehalt, relativ frei von Sorgen.Als zweite Person erscheint sein Neffe, der Sohn seiner Schwester, aufgewachsen und gebildet in Paris. Er ist ein durch und durch hoch gebildeter traditioneller Europäer, ebenfalls mit jüdischen Wurzeln in Russland. Seine Welt sind die russischen Autoren des 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. Er hat einen Lehrauftrag an der Universität in Chicago und führt dort in seinem exotischen Fachgebiet ein angenehmes Nischendasein. Auch hier ein winzig kleines Feld, eine kleine Insel im Getriebe der Neuen Welt. Gegen den ausdrücklichen Willen seiner französisch/europäischen Eltern geht er zu diesem besagten Onkel nach Chicago, um einerseits von ihm zu lernen, andererseits ihn zu beschützen. Dieser Onkel ist die einzige Bezugsperson, die er in Amerika hat.Zwei russische Juden in der Neuen Welt, ein Thema, welches Bellow immer wieder aufgreiftDie Geschichte kreist um die Beziehung zu ihren jeweiligen Frauen, die verschiedener nicht sein können. Der junge Neffe liebt eine einfache, fast primitive, animalisch anmutende, zwergenhaft pralle Frau, mit der er ein Kind zusammen hat.Der Onkel heiratet eine „Schönheit"", gebildet, klug, aus allerbesten Kreisen Chicagos.Die Handlung soll nicht verraten werden. Aber wie der Titel schon sagt:More Die of Heartbreak"". 10.02.2018Dobelli und andere Literaturliebhaber sagen, gute Bücher müsse man zweimal lesen. Dann erschließe sich eigentlich erst der Sinn des Inhaltes in seiner ganzen Weite und Tiefe.Nach einigen Jahren wurde dieses Buch also zum zweiten Mal gelesen und zwar mit Freude und Gewinn. Die Rahmenhandlung ist klar, man erkennt, dass unter diesem Ablauf der Handlung jedoch noch einiges mehr steckt. Die fein gesponnenen Unterschiede der Beziehungen der beiden Männer erscheinen in einem klareren Bild. Dabei denkt der Autor intensiv und sehr ausgiebig über die Beziehungen von Mann und Frau nach, eine große Zahl von Philosophen wird zitiert und interpretiert, grundsätzliche Fragen werden aufgeworfen, Erhellendes und Widersprüchliches.Auf der einen Seite der Botaniker Benn, der letztlich nur als eine Figur im hochgestochenem, korrupten, letztlich ihm völlig fremden Umfeld einer vermeintlichen absoluten Oberschicht benutzt wird. Ein in deren Augen skuriler, weltfremder, allerdings auch weltweit anerkannter Wissenschaftler, der gut in die Einrichtung, in das Inventar der Familie passt, ohne dass seine wahre Bedeutung und sein wahrer menschlicher Wert zur Kenntnis genommen werden. Liebe ist bei seiner Ehefrau (und auch bei ihm) nicht im Spiel, nur die Aufwertung ihres Salons, ihrer Partys, ihrer sozialen Aktivitäten durch einen originalen Wissenschaftler sind gefragt. Dabei ist die wissenschaftliche Arbeit selbst absolut uninteressant und wird eher mit milden Spott betrachtet, als die Marotte eines zwar hoch intelligenten, jedoch eher belächelten Professors außerhalb der Realität seiner neuen Familie. Wen interessieren Flechten in der Antarktis, über die Benn, der Botaniker, bahnbrechende Erkenntnisse gewinnen konnte. Ihre Ziele sind ausschließlich Geld, Macht, politischer Einfluss. Korruption und Betrug sind die verwendeten Werkzeuge. Hilfreich für seine neue Familie ist zudem die Tatsache, dass man durch die wirtschaftliche und körperliche Vernichtung eines Verwandten des Botanikers an ein riesiges Vermögen kommen kann, was der Tochter und damit der Ehefrau des Wissenschaftlers ein sorgenfreies Leben in Luxus ermöglichen würde.Die Beziehung des 2. Protagonisten, des Literaturwissenschaftlers ist auf ganz andere Weise interessant und psychologisch aufschlussreich.Nochmals: Eines der Meisterwerke des Saul Bellow. Es ist ein Vergnügen und ein intellektueller Genuss, in diesen Roman einzutauchen und sich dort eine Zeit lang zu verlieren.', 'Very nice collection this Penguin modern classics.

Kings and Queens, battles and skirmishes, are interesting, as examples, say, of how the other half lived, but to my mind it is what happened to the vast majority, not what happened to the privileged minority that is of primary importance and most worth knowing about. So you can keep your Philippa Gregories and your Anya Setons, and give me the down and dirty truths of history. Books such as Adam Thorpe’s The Rules of Perspective or in another theatre of war, the fictional but accurate drug wars of Don Winslow’s Power of the Dog, for all it’s ‘romantic’ excesses. Stones From The River is up there with the best of these. A tremendous tour de force which takes as it’s protagonist a Zwerg (dwarf) woman and encompasses the loneliness, the terror and pity of war. It’s not enough to merely include the victors and victims of war, the tremendous upheaval of countries and shifting borders – that’s just the “what” of what happened. A book such as this one reveals so much more. This book is also about the “why” and the “how” of the tragedy of what happened in Germany. A small town is the setting. Not at the epicentre of war, more on the edge, but nonetheless devastated. It allows the reader to understand why and how, Hitler’s mad designs flourished. When you are ‘different’ to others, you are more in danger of standing out, and Trudi is a dwarf. She cannot expect the conventions of courtship and marriage. She’s a ‘freak’ and she learns early that what she feels on the inside does not translate to the conventional life. Her adolescence is a travesty, her kind and protective father is a foil for her unbalanced mother, her life cannot ever be ordinary. The glowering atmosphere of the book encompasses the danger of the times, her induction to cruelty starts with school, goes onto maturity. A fleeting experience of love brings her hope, but comes to nothing. Trudi and her father shelter fugitives the wider community is either too fearful to help, or too convinced of their inferiority, Jews, Gypsies, who can step out of their lives and disappear without trace, unless someone helps them. They manage how they can, a small group of people in the town, and one benefactor who uses his position to subvert the Nazi regime. These are the exceptions, a handful of escapees, a few among them brave enough to defy Hitler. It doesn’t amount to much. The town is a fearful, angry, helpless place in the main.

The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and eventually comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. A classic piece filled with comedy, its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage and money during the Regency era in Great Britain.Mr Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but because his property is entailed it can only be passed from male heir to male heir. Consequently, Mr Bennet\'s family will be destitute upon his death. Because his wife also lacks an inheritance, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others upon his death, which is a motivation that drives the plot. Jane Austen\'s opening line--""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife""—is a sentence filled with irony and sets the tone for the book. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not simply for economic gain or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a good (i.e., wealthy) match.Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of ""most-loved books"" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature with over 20 million copies sold and has inspired many derivatives that abound in modern literature.[1][2] For more than a century, amateur and professional dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.[3] The 2005 film Pride & Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, is the most recent film adaptation that closely represents the book, with the 2016 action, comedy, and horror spin-off Pride and Prejudice and Zombies being the most recent Hollywood film adaptation.[4]387 people found this helpful.Review menu iconProfile imageMatthew Yim10 months agot is a truth universally acknowledged that some stories are capable of resisting the passage of time.In her most recognized work, Austen tells us the story of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Bennet, the second of five daughters of a rural family.

The family lives in a pleasant home called Loungborn, however they are all concerned for the day Mr. Bennet dies and Loungborn is inherited to Mr. Collins. Their only home would be gone, and they would be under the mercy of Mr. Collins, a distant cousin they hardly even know. Mrs. Bennet\'s plan to save the girls and herself is simple, have all the girls marry and then they’ll have their own comfortable homes and wealth. Now the story truly begins, when a wealthy bachelor named Mr. Charles Bingley moves into the estate Netherfield near Loungborn. Accompanied with him is his close friend Fizwillam Darcy and his sister Caroline Bingley. The Bennet’s almost immediately fall in love with Mr. Bingley and believe he will be the perfect husband for their oldest daughter Jane. While Jane and Mr. Bingley are enjoying each other\'s company, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are despising each other’s presence. But when Jane gets sick, Mr. Bingley mysteriously leaves Netherfield, a trip to Kent, a shocking letter with terrible truth, and a terrible threat that can ruin the Bennet\'s family reputation arises, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth discover that they have more in common than they thought. Jane Austen’s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a gripping tale of love, marriage, and social status.  It can be universally acknowledged that Pride and Prejudice is a classic beloved novel. From the very beginning this book sucks you in. When I first received this book, I thought I would only sit down and read a chapter or two and then continue to go on with my day. After the first two chapters, I was intrigued and had to read another chapter, and then another, and then another. Before I knew it, I had read about six chapters and gained questionable looks from family members who could not understand why I was captivated by a simple book I had only started reading that morning. By the end of the day my mind was shifted from regular thoughts about daily chores and things to do the next day, and was focused on what would happen in the next chapter. The entire story is beautifully written, every event that happens results in the resolution.  Each event in the book is essential, there is no event that does not have a purpose in the story. Each character has a unique and different personality, which I appreciate. Elizabeth Bennet is very witty and intelligent, Mr. Bennet is sarcastic, Mrs. Bennet is excitable, and Jane Bennet is kindhearted. The character development is absolutely remarkable. The characters learn their mistakes, work hard to fix them (with time, practice, and a few mistakes here and there), and eventually fix their mistakes and flaws. Although some may say the story is “dull,” I however found the story quite gripping. Chapter 46 was so shocking to me, that I had to stop reading to comprehend the dreadful news.  After reading Pride and Prejudice I find myself recommending this book to all my friends and family who are searching for a next great read. If you are interested in reading a book about romance, Drama, and England, Pride and Prejudice will be perfect for you. Fans of any classic literature, Jane Austen, and Little Women will love Pride and Prejudice.', 'I would sum up the review in just one line- "" A book everyone should read atleast once in their life !!""

When Elizabeth Bennet meets Fitzwilliam Darcy for the first time at a ball, she writes him off as an arrogant and obnoxious man. He not only acts like an insufferable snob, but she also overhears him rejecting the very idea of asking her for a dance! As life pits them against each other again and again, Darcy begins to fall for Elizabeth's wit and intelligence and Elizabeth begins to question her feelings about Darcy. But when Darcy saves

Barron zips back in time to explore the history of that quirky little character, and his relationship to the legendary wizard Merlin. ""The Dragon of Avalon"" runs a bit slow at first, but speeds up to some surprising revelations about the mysterious little winged lizard who wants to be ""special. Just... special.""At the very beginning of Avalon, a wind sister rescues and cares for a tiny egg -- which hatches a little winged lizard with a knobby tail.Barely surviving in a dangerous world, the little lizard has a near miss with a heron, who reveals that little Basil has the ability to make smells. Unfortunately Basil also has a nightmare about the legendary wizard Merlin, in which he is killed by a bat-winged creature who looks a lot like Basil himself. Over the years, he tries to tell Merlin many times but kept getting interrupted.Unfortunately, Basil\'s strange dream is not the only problem -- after an encounter with the god Dagda, he learns that the evil Rhita Gawr has managed to infiltrate the newborn world of Avalon. And though he\'s still only a bat-winged little lizard, Basil may be the one who can save Avalon -- and maybe, just maybe, figure out what he really is.""The Dragon of Avalon"" is a bit of a nostalgia ride for those who have read Barron\'s last two trilogies -- he writes of things only hinted at in the Great Tree of Avalon trilogy, such as Merlin\'s wedding to his deer-girlfriend Hallia. And there are plenty of familiar and semi-familiar faces -- Shim the giant, Gwynnia the dragon, the Dagda, Nuic the maryth, the Grand Elusa, and many others. Even a ""mooshlovely"" ballymag makes a cameo.The first third of the book is a relatively slow-moving part -- it\'s mostly poor little Basil repeatedly avoiding dangerous creatures and trying to figure out what he is. With the reemergence of Rhita Gawr, things speed up considerably as Basil careens into magical new realms. And it all climaxes with his battle with a magic-sucking monster and the realization of what he truly is -- although the whole conflict with Rhita Gawr is only hinted at and never really gets done in here.And Barron\'s lush, mildly humorous prose is still rich with woodsy language, full of trees, leaves, wild creatures and the scent of damp earth and flowing rivers. Even more impressive, he\'s able to convincingly take readers into the mind and feelings of a little lizard with batwings -- not an easy feat, especially since his past heroes have been human.A kind and wise Merlin is a vital character in this story, and we get to see him marry, become a father, and protect Avalon. But the real star here is Basil, who can be a bit whiny but is overall quite brave and gutsy when he has a real task to perform. And he provides a bit of comedy too -- such as when he gets into a brawl with a baby dragon.""The Dragon of Avalon"" is a rich, promising fantasy story about a very unlikely little hero, and bodes well for future books about the little ""dragon fairy.""', 'T. A. Barron es un de mis escritores favoritos y me ha encantado desde muy pequeño.Lo recomiendo. No puedo decir mas.', 'My 16 year old granddaughter is enjoying the series.

It still holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the series that really got me stuck into scifi and fantasy fiction.Damia continues the story started in The Rowan. Damia being one of the Rowan's daughters.Damia was always a bit of a weird title for this book though seeing as more than half of the book is from the point of view of Afra or other characters. Indeed the first third is completely Afra's story during the events of The Rowan.The book is definitely a product of it's time (when it was written) and although I love it so much - would probably NOT reccomend it to new and younger readers, unless they are looking to deliberately explore older writing.Note: Amazon insists this series has 6 books - it does not, it only has 5. (But there is a prequel trilogy available - To Ride Pegasus, Pegasus In Flight and Pegasus In Space)"", ""I read The Rowan years ago, and enjoyed it very much. Sci-Fi, however, is not my thing, but a special price Kindle offer had me re-reading it and once again being captured by the quality of the writing, the characters, and the most amazing imagination. I bought 'Damia' yesterday, spent until the early hours of this morning completing it, and have just downloaded Vol 3.Despite some reviews which would appear to have completely missed the new perspectives of Afra's upbringing and youthful experiences, and his involvement with The Rowan and her ever-growing family, this volume takes us forward by short leaps through the growing up of Damia, third (and most Talented) child of The Rowan, through her trials, tribulations - and tantrums - to her eventual maturity. There are times when she is thoroughly unpleasant, selfish, and utterly inconsiderate, yet, when she is so rejected by her elder siblings, and clearly takes second (if so far toward the front) place to their careers in the lives of her parents, there is much that is understandable in her conduct.The adventures, misadventures, triumphs and tragedies that unfold are brilliantly described, and utterly enthralling. Then there's the added bonus of space travel, Talents, aliens, and the wonderful Coonies.I do believe that, to enjoy this book to the full, you have to have read 'The Rowan' first. It is, after all, a different world way out there, and if you don't know from where and how and whom the characters have come, you'll be the biggest alien of them all."", 'I grew up reading Anne Macaffry and have fond memories of her work however on rereading this, I find the focus of a much older man/much younger woman pairing uncomfortable.  Add in the point that he was something of a father figure to her and is quoted as starting to have feeling for her when she was as young as 14 and red flags really start going up.The power differential in this relationship is just plan wrong and it makes reading this more than a little uncomfortable.On the other hand, I do enjoy the idea of useful psychic abilities, how they might contribute towards space travel as well as contact with alien species. Unfortunately you have to skim over a lot of really quite bad relationship discussions to get to the good!']";

I suggest starting with this book first; even I, as a Muslim, learned things from it that I knew not before. It is set in an easy literary format to follow: asking the important questions (as part of the text) and then answering them; it also copiously quotes from Muslim sources—particularly the Quran and the Hadith (both of which it describes)—as well as from external texts. Some may claim that this book is bias; it is not: it merely presents Islam from a favorable perspective, I.E., that of a Muslim. Excerpts, in my opinion, help in a decision. This edition seems to have more content then the subsequent revisions. Therefore, the below excerpt is taken from Chapter 8 “The Measurement of Life. “Islam teaches that even though God knows the future, we can still act and make a difference in our ultimate fate. How does Islam balance God\'s knowledge of the future with our ability to act? The synthesis comes in a grand concept that can almost be described as managed time. What do we mean by this?The Islamic answer begins with God\'s foreknowledge. God knows the past, present, and future all at the same time. He can do this for one simple reason: He created time and so is not bound by it....... He is merely outside the timeline, looking at us in every stage of our lives. He knows where we will end up tomorrow; however, He is letting time flow, so we can live out our natural lives and experience life for ourselves……Islam provides a unique mechanism to free ourselves from this kind of worrying about the future. This doctrine is called Qada and Qadr, loosely translated as Determination and Measurement. Qada, which means to determine or to set parameters, covers the span of life for the universe and how it will operate. Gravity causes apples to fall; fire burns combustibles; illnesses can be treated with the right medications, etc. Using this principle we can live life confidently, knowing that we can make sense of our world and the rules with which it operates. The second principle to make our lives a little easier is Qadr, which means to measure. All things, including people, are dependent on God, and He has measured our life circumstances to provide a varied and challenging test for us to pass. What does this mean in practical terms? Beyond measuring the length of our lives, God will throw a specific set of challenges our way, so we can make choices and learn to live by faith and virtue--or descend into a life of nihilism and immorality. All along our timelines are stumbling blocks and situations that we must react to. When we consider that God has intertwined everyone\'s timelines and how this creates a never-ending web of actions and reactions, we can get dizzy trying to sort it out! How does this concept of measurement help us to live free from anxiety? Basically, if we say that God has measured the circumstances in our life, we can free ourselves from being overly stressed about what happens to us every day. When we are stricken with calamities, our anxiety is reduced and our despair is mitigated because we trust in God\'s measurement or preordainment of our tests. Life, therefore, is a test and not a series of punishments and thus a Muslim\'s belief in the goodness of God and the essential rightness of His overall plan remains intact. The question remains: Can we change what will happen to us? Does prayer or our active participation in a situation have any effect on the outcome of events? Islam says yes. Muhammad said, ""Nothing changes the Divine Measurement except fervent supplications (to God)."" As God looks at our timeline, there may be a place where we decide to call on Him for His help. In that case, God may change the course of our future. In so doing, His foreknowledge is not affected. In His mercy, He may decide at any moment to alter our timeline and respond to our prayers, so Muslims are asked to make supplications to God often. As you can see, then, Muslims put their trust in God\'s foreknowledge and accept that what happens to them will be a test. But because we have the power to act and react and even to ask God to change things, Muslims always hold out hope that their active participation can influence the course of their lives. In the end, they trust in God and in His knowledge of their ultimate fate: ""Whatever good happens to you is from Allah; but whatever evil happens to you is from your [own] self."" (Qur\'an 4:79)…….. Islam divides daily life into two spheres: what we have control over and what we do not. We have no control over the circumstances developing around us. The car breaks down; we\'re get laid off at our job; an earthquake topples the city; we bump into a long-lost friend; we find a bag of money; the dog runs away, and so on. These things just happen. We couldn\'t prevent them because we didn\'t know they were coming. Islam says all of these things are a test for us. They were predetermined challenges. They were our Divine Measurement.Islam never teaches that we should sit around and wait for whatever is supposed to happen to us. We must participate, take action, and, when results come in, accept what happened and not be filled with endless ""What ifs."" The Prophet Muhammad advised us to say, ""God has planned; He has carried out His plan, and I will be patient."" Just because we don\'t like the results of our life\'s challenges doesn\'t mean they weren\'t good for us……. Trusting in God and His plan while taking action is the Muslim way. ""Tie your camel and then put your trust in God,"" the Prophet once told a man who asked which he should do first. God knows the future, and we can rest assured He is the best Planner. ……Ex-Ch9there is no Tower of Babel in the Qur\'an. Islam gives a very reasonable and balanced explanation for the spread of people over the Earth and their unique experiences. To begin our answer, the Qur\'an states that the earliest human beings lived together in one community or tribe until the group became too large to sustain a cohesive social life. The Qur\'an says that ""they fell into disputes with one another and scattered"" over the Earth. Another interesting verse even gives us a beneficial side effect for this dispersal around the world. It states, ""O People! We created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes so you can come to know each other. The noblest among you in the sight of Allah is the one with the most spiritual awareness."" (Qur\'an 49:13) So Islam views the diversity of languages and cultures in our world as a natural process caused by the movement of people here and there. It is a source of richness, wonder, and discovery. Multiculturalism has a treasured place in Islamic ideology; and according to the Qur\'an, the only criterion for differentiating among people lies in the strength of their religious sentiment. Muslims are thus taught that race is not a legitimate standard of measurement. Islam has often been praised for its emphasis on the equality of all people regardless of race, creed, or color. Given this understanding of natural human movement Muslims thus can agree with anthropologists who have traced back to a single region in east Africa…', ""I am a Christian who loves to read and study and learn.I found this book very informative. It did a good job of explaining what true Islam (not radical Islam) is like, and covers almost all of the area's an American Christian would question, such as how women are treated, what's the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite, what Jihad means, etc.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that, although not biased, the author does err a little bit when making some comparison between Islam and Christian practices and the Koran vs. the Bible, etc., but these where minor and I did not buy the book to see how nuch he knows about Christianity but rather what he could teach me about Islam."", 'This book is excellent for new Muslims, the information is very accurate and up to date.']";"Islam may be the most misunderstood faith in history. Most of us learn little or nothing about Islam in school; in fact, our knowledge of Muslims may be restricted to news reports on the Middle East and Louis Farrakhan. Surprise--the vast majority of Muslims aren't Arabs, the Muslim Allah is very much the ""one God"" Christians and Jews believe in, many of the scientific and medical innovations we take for granted were passed on by Muslims, and the popular myths about Muslims often have little to do with the real beliefs of Islam.

Die Galaxis braucht einen neuen Jedi-Orden. Doch zunächst muss Luke erst einmal einen Standort und geeignete Kandidaten für sein Jedi Praxeum finden. Auch Lando Calrissian hilft ihm dabei aus.Während Luke und Lando nach aussichtsreichen Jedi-Schülern suchen sind Han und Chewbacca auf diplomatischer Mission nach Kessel unterwegs. Der alte Haudgegen wird jedoch mit feuernden Geschützen anstatt einem roten Teppich empfangen und findet sich wenig später als Häftling in der Sträflingskolonie wieder, die nun von Ex-Häftlingen geführt wird...~ Architekten des Expanded Universe ~Timothy Zahn wird gerne zugeschrieben der Vater des Expanded Universe gewesen zu sein und das stimmt auch, denn er hat es auf den Weg gebracht. Doch es waren schließlich auch noch andere Autoren an der Ausgestaltung dessen beteiligt, was später als als die typische Form des EU bekannt werden sollte. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Michael Stackpole und Timothy Zahn schuf etwa die Grundlage dessen, worauf sich später zahllose andere Autorinnen und Autoren stützen sollten - sie machten das EU erst zu einem wahren shared universe, in dem Charaktere aus dem einen Roman auch in einem anderen auftauchen konnten. Neben Zahn und Stackpole war es jedoch auch der umtriebige Kevin J. Anderson der zu einem der Architekten des EU wurde. Anderson arbeitete mit Tom Veitch an den TALES OF THE JEDI, die bereits ein Spinoff zu DARK EMPIRE waren und band die TALES OF THE JEDI schließlich auch durch Exar Kun, Vodo-Siosk Baas und die Massassi Tempel auf Yavin 4 in JEDI ACADEMY ein. Die JEDI ACADEMY Trilogie zog wiederum Michael Stackpoles Corran Horn-Spinoff I, JEDI, einen Comic, sowie die direkte Fortsetzung DARKSABER nach sich. Später folgten aufbauend auf JEDI ACADEMY auch noch die YOUNG JEDI KNIGHTS-Jugendbücher Andersons und seiner Co-Autorin Rebecca Moesta. Rebecca Moesta und Nancy Richardson schufen schließlich auch die JUNIOR JEDI KNIGHT-Jugendbücher, in denen nach Jacen und Jaina Solo auch Anakin Solo in die Jedi-Akademie eintrat. Kevin J. Andersons Trilogie über die Jedi Akademie wurde über die Jahre zu einem Herzstück des EU, das allerdings deutlich umstrittener war als Zahns Thrawn-Trilogie. Doch auch Michael Stackpole sah sich mit seinen Werken genauso häufig und genauso heftiger Kritik konfrontiert, nur bei Zahn fehlt dem Fandom die Toleranz für Kritik, irgendeinen gemeinsamen Nenner braucht man dann doch.Lukes Akademie auf Yavin 4 wurde auch zum Schauplatz zweier Videospiele (Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast und Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy) und selbst im neuen Kanon versuchte schon vor Episode VII eine Jedi-Akademie zu gründen. Der Einfluss von Andersons 1994 veröffentlichter Trilogie lässt sich kaum unterschätzen und wenn man sich mit seinem Stil anfreunden kann wird einem in dieser wirklich einiges geboten.~ Die Suche ~JEDI SEARCH ist wie der Titel bereits verrät noch knapp vor der Eröffnung von Lukes Akademie angesiedelt, Luke erhält im Zuge der Handlung auch erst die Erlaubnis seine Jedi-Akademie ausgerechnet auf Yavin 4 zu eröffnen. Im Hintergrund hat Luke allerdings bereits eine handvoll Kandidaten bereit, die zur Gründer-Generation des neuen Ordens werden könnten. Trotzdem jagt Luke noch unbestätigten Berichten über mögliche Machtsensitive nach. Eine Suche bei der ihm auch Lando Calrissian zur Hand geht, der Luke allerdings nicht begleitet und anderenorts einer heißen Spur nachgeht. Die hellseherischen Fähigkeiten der Jedi-Ritter und ihre daraus resultierenden übernatürlichen Reflexe machen sie auch zu überdurchschnittlich erfolgreichen Glücksspielern und das ist ein Metier in dem sich Lando auskennt wie kein zweiter. Selbst Han hilft Luke einen möglichen Jedi-Rekruten zu finden, wenn auch sehr unfreiwillig, ist er doch auf Kessel gefangen. Ich finde es nur schade, dass man sich lediglich auf Kyp Durron, Gantoris und Streen konzentriert hat, zumal es mich auch interessiert hätte wie Luke auf Tionne stieß oder wie er die Hexe von Dathomir Kirana Ti zu einer Jedi-Ausbildung überreden konnte. ~ Die neuen Jedi-Ritter: Der Einsiedler, der Häftling und der Anführer ~An einem Mangel an Diversität unter der Herkunft von Lukes Jedi-Schülern kann man sich kaum beklagen. Die Gründer-Generation ist bunt zusammen gewürfelt und besteht aus Nachkommen von Jedi-Rittern (wie Kam Solusar), ebenso wie aus solchen in denen Macht ohne altes Jedi-Blut im Stammbaum erwacht ist (Dorsk-81). JEDI SEARCH führt viele interessante Charaktere ein, von denen manche allerdings jahrelang nie wieder ins Rampenlicht gerieten und nur Nebenrollen spielten. Mit Ausnahme Kyp Durrons, der zumindest am Beginn des THE NEW JEDI ORDER Zyklus noch eine tragende Rolle spielte.Gantoris war Lukes erster Hoffnungsträger, im EU kam ihm die Rolle des Vorgängers von Kyp Durron zu. Im Gegensatz zu Kyp musste man bei Gantoris jedoch nicht auf die Erklärung zurückgreifen, dass sein Macht-Potential sogar noch über Lukes lag. Der Anführer der Kolonisten von Eol Sha hatte das nicht nötig, sein Potential als Jedi-Kandidat kam davon, dass er bereits ohne Training einige wichtige Machtfähigkeiten entwickelt hatte. So konnte Gantoris durch Visionen und seine Machtsinne bereits Erdbeben orten ehe diese eintraten und seine durch die Macht verstärkten akrobatischen Fähigkeiten (Machtsprung vor allem) waren ihm manövrieren beim Retten seiner Mitmenschen aus Erdspalten sicher nützlich. Gantoris plagten jedoch auch Visionen von einem dunklen Mann, mit dem zu gehen, das Ende für ihn bedeuten würde, weshalb er Luke auf Eol Sha einer Prüfung seiner Jedi-Fähigkeiten unterzog.Der Einsiedler Streen wieß genau wie Gantoris einen ausgeprägten Spürsinn auf, doch Streens durch die Macht geschärfte Sinne machten es ihm auch schwer unter größeren Menschenansammlungen zu leben. Gantoris und Streen waren die ersten Beispiele dafür, wie untrainierte Machtanwender unter ihren Fähigkeiten leiden können, etwas das im EU ansonsten kaum thematisiert wurde. Ihre Jedi-Ausbildung sollte beiden helfen ihre Fähigkeiten kontrollieren zu lernen, um sie so von ihrem Leid zu befreien.Kyp Durron ist ein Opfer des imperialen Regimes und überlebte ähnlich wie Gantoris nur dank seiner ausgeprägten Machtfähigkeiten das Leben in den Minen von Kessel. Kyps Familie wurde ihm vom Imperium genommen und doch ist der junge Mann nicht 24h am Tag ein hasserfüllter Racheengel. Han Solo sieht in Kyp ein wenig von sich selbst.~ Natasi Daala und die imperialen Superwaffen ~Die letzten Romane der Reihe LEGACY OF THE FORCE und FATE OF THE JEDI haben Natasi Daala im EU noch einmal ganz groß gemacht, nachdem sie ein Jahrzehnt zuvor nur in der JEDI ACADEMY Trilogie und DARKSABER eine Rolle spielte. Im EU hat Daala schon damals großes vollbracht, sie versuchte die Strategie der Rebellen-Allianz gegen die Neue Republik zu verwenden und sie vereinte in DARKSABER handstreichartig die zerstrittenen Fraktionen der Imperialen Kriegsherrn. Neben Ysanne Isard, Großadmiral Thrawn und dem Kriegsherrn Zsinj war sie eine der größten imperialen Bedrohungen der Bantam-Ära. Als Daalas (derzeit) wahrscheinlichste Nachfolgerin im neuen Kanon wird bisher Admiralin Rae Sloane gehandelt, die auch Eigenschaften des späteren Großadmirals Pellaeons aufweist.Nur wer war Daala? Admiralin Daala war wie Großadmiral Thrawn eines jener strategischen Genies, die zwar gefördert, aber dann doch an einen Ort versetzt wurden, wo sie ihren männlichen menschlichen Kollegen kein Dorn im Auge waren. Vor der Zerstörung des ersten Todessterns war sie ein Schützling Grand Moff Tarkins, der sie mit dem Schutz der Maw Installation betraute, die auch noch in den Jahren nach der Zerstörung des zweiten Todessterns neue Superwaffen entwickelte. Die Existenz eines solchen von der Außenwelt abgeschotteten Thinktanks macht zwar Sinn, im neuen Kanon dürfte sich die Entwicklung des Todessterns aber weitgehend auf Geonosis verlagert haben. In der Bantam-Ära störte man sich allerdings genauso an Daala wie auch an der Existenz vergessener Superwaffen und Kevin J. Andersons ist daran nicht ganz unschuldig. Mit dem Todesstern-Prototyp und dem Sun Crusher führte er in JEDI SEARCH gleich zwei vergessene imperiale Superwaffen ein, dazu kommt, dass Daala zu ihrer Zeit eben auch nur wie eine weitere Kriegsherrin wirkte. Über 20 Jahre später sieht man diese Dinge bereits wieder anders.~ Zusammenfassend ~JEDI SEARCH hat vieles was Star Wars ausmacht, Raumschlachten, Action, die Macht und Aufbruchsstimmung. Band 1 der JEDI ACADEMY Trilogie umfasst, um es mit den Worten Ben Kenobis zu beschreiben die ""first steps into a larger world"". Gerade die für die Legends sehr essentielle Story verleiht der Trilogie den gewissen Mehrwert und mit der laufenden Entwicklung neuer Star Wars-Filme kann es auch passieren, dass die eine oder andere Idee aus den Legends Eingang in den Kanon finden könnte. Selbst wenn die Bücher dem Kanon völlig widersprechen, sie sind zumindest kurzweilige Unterhaltung.', 'Not an bad book but was expecting a lot more about the ""Jedi Search"", but it turned out to barely even feature Luke Skywalker...', ""Before this trilogy I read the Thrawn trilogy.

The machinations are not intricate, but there are one or two surprises along the way.  Fans of the series will contrast Annabel's solo work in this mystery with the role she has played in solving other mysteries alongside her husband Mac.  The book also follows the progress of an art thief as he flees from the powerful forces he has angered.  His frantic maneuvers are a welcome complement to Annabel's relatively sedate activities in Washington, DC.Annabel spends most of her time working in the Library of Congress, working to meet a deadline for a special article in one of the Library's journals.  The author does an admirable job not only describing the Library, but helping readers to feel its influence on those who visit and work there.  Well-crafted descriptions capture the experience of arriving as a first-time researcher, slowly absorbing, then beginning to act in harmony with the Library's quiet, elegant and inspiring atmosphere.  We are given not only a picture of the physical Library, but an overview of its history and the workings of its current organization.  The Library's researchers and other staff are portrayed believably, making their way through the politics and bureaucracy found in any Federal agency.The book is a good read for those who can ignore its minor flaws, and not expect the plot to be more than an entertaining story.

The story was not the most original by today's standards, but it was told very well.  The characters were all believable and interesting.  Big surprise or twist at the end?  Not really, but she had me to the last page.  From now on, whether it's for information or for mood, when it come to Washington, I am going to Margaret first!"", ""I am usually not a mystery reader, and there was no mystery in this book.

Through this meeting of the heart, however, Morris is soon led to cross paths with another love of his life...only this time it is in the form of a cat.Though the book itself is a bit on the small size, every page, every paragraph, is a gem. Morris chronicles the small-town atmosphere of the South with eloquence, grace, and wonderfully verbose style. And when he describes his own emotions - wrestling with the fact that his intense disdain for cats, especially those who come  to live with him, is in fact completely groundless - the result is a marvelous blend of humor and, ultimately, love. The title character (and the reason for the book), Spit McGee, is so well detailed by Morris that by the end of the story I became quite wistful, saddened that I never had the opportunity to meet this magnificent creature myself. Or for that matter, the author.""My Cat Spit McGee"" is a must-read for anyone who loves cats, or animals in general.

Forced to confront a lifetime of kitty-phobia when he marries a cat woman, Willie discovers that Spit McGee, a feisty kitten with one blue and one gold eye, is nothing like the foul felines that lurk in his nightmares. For when Spit is just three weeks old he nearly dies, but is saved by Willie with a little help from Clinic Cat, which provides a blood transfusion.

He is the only person to host all three major NBC News programs: The Today Show, NBC Nightly News, and, briefly, Meet the Press. He now serves as a Special Correspondent for NBC news. We don’t know much about him in India since none of our Satellite platforms beams NBC. For my Indian friends, if I have to pitch him – he is like a much improved version of Prannoy Roy without the best-selling books.How would you classify A LUCKY LIFE INTERRUPTED?Is this the story of the great American dream – simple middle class guy, marrying his childhood sweetheart, happy family - thru dint of hard work, conquers the dizzying heights of fame in his profession? (With his later day cancer and related issues as a peg)OrIs it the story of how human beings think and behave when a life threatening disease stares at you and reminds of the imminent mortality?OrIs it the story of hope – of conquering a rare disease to which so many succumb to?My view is that it is a mix of all three – and written in a very warm way. Of discovering that he is afflicted by Multiple Myeloma with a slim chance of cure. It is the story of his life, his success, the support that his family provided (by American standards…he does a 10/10 on this) and also grateful acknowledgement of the medical fraternity that got him back to almost normalcy. In passing, his views on healthcare (and its astronomical costs) in America are also insightful.A pervasive phenomenon in life that all of us live with is that ‘s*** happens to someone else’ and not to our lucky lives (which we all worked so hard and built it). How would you feel (it is a separate matter, the author was in in his early 70s when he was discovered with cancer) when death comes knocking on your doorstep. These are issues that the author writes brilliantly about...you almost choke when reading.Tom Brokaw has seen it all – He was there when the Berlin wall collapsed, interviewed all the movers and shakers of the contemporary world, written extensively on 911 and thereafter. Possibly - any talented writer and commentator can do - in third person - giving a clinical view of the world that is changing and giving their insights. This comes easily to a lot of authors / TV anchors / journalists…..but how do you write when YOU are the subject yourself and diagnosed with a debilitating disease – which even if it is cured – life will not be normal again. Believe Art Buchwald (Too soon to say Goodbye) has also written on this subject and think I should read that also soon.( remember reading his column / and also his humorous book on American politics / politicians when I was young).The book also is inspirational in a certain way. Heroic stories of guys who conquer the odds and come back on top always make a good read.', ""I always found Tom Brokaw's reporting style a mix of seriousness, eloquence, and honesty. He just had a way of speaking that was accessible to me, although at times I could not fully understand the wide and deep vocabulary that he used.  It was actually with that same slight trepidation that I started reading this book, fearful that it would be too academic for me, or worse, too dull as a consequence.  It was neither. Tom's writing is inspired, with warmth and wit and a keen observing eye on his surroundings. I did find the allusions to his financial means and well known friends a bit much by the end, but thought, well, if you have it, flaunt it?!...... I finished the book in two days....about the time it take me to read a an grossing summer thriller where I habitually gloss over the descriptor prose. Tom's book, I read every word. I felt touched by his stories and his plight. And I felt inspired to think differently about health and age and life.

It is a book I will never  forget.THIS IS GRACEANNE'S BOOK transports the reader to the year 1960  and to Cranepool's Landing, Missouri, a small town on the bank of the  Mississippi River.  Nine-year-old Charlie Farrand tells the story of a year  in the lives of the Farrand family, a year when the temperament of the  river was variable and unpredictable.  Sometimes it was tranquil, flowing  with lazy calmness, and other times it was turbulent, its destructive  currents leaving wreckage along its path.  And so it was in the Farrand  home.It was the year of Ugly Blue Man.  It was the year when a Negro  girl became the Farrand kids' best friend.  It was the year when  twelve-year-old Graceanne was abused by her mother, and Charlie learned how  to protect her, and Graceanne learned how to save herself.  And it was the  year when imagination and the magic of the planets saved them  both.Charlie's narrative voice is so clear and believable that I  remembered what it felt like to be a child -- when you knew you weren't  smart enough to understand things adults said and did; and when you wanted  more than anything to be able to do things better, but you were just a kid,  and you didn't know how.  Charlie reminded me of how frustrating it was to  be a kid.Graceanne reminded me what it was like to be a kid, too -- when  you had confidence to try anything because you knew you could do it; and  when you had a brother and a sister you loved more than anything, but that  didn't stop you from fighting with them.  Graceanne reminded me of how  smart I felt when I was a kid.  Together, Charlie and Graceanne reminded me  how wonderful, yet how difficult it was to be a child.The writing in  THIS IS GRACEANNE'S BOOK is elegant and poetic, and the prose possesses a  rhythmic cadence that serves as a subtle reminder of the continual presence  of the river.  The river is a integral element throughout the story, and it  is so richly described that it remains in my memory as vividly as do the  human characters.  The prose is at once gentle in voice and powerful in  imagery  and emotion, capable of soothing the reader at one moment and  shattering the reader the next.Readers who are familiar with Ms.  Whitney's mystery series will be surprised and enchanted by this novel --  surprised because THIS IS GRACEANNE'S BOOK is not a mystery and the style  is unlike the styles we have seen previously from Ms. Whitney, and readers  will be enchanted by the beauty of the prose and the impact of the story.  In THIS IS GRACEANNE'S BOOK, Ms. Whitney addresses themes of importance,  and she does so eloquently.Some events in GRACEANNE are disturbing, but  ultimately, THIS IS GRACEANNE'S BOOK is a celebration of spirit.  It is a  book filled with wonders.  From now on, whenever I look at Mars, I will  think of Graceanne and wonder what the astronomers are up to.  This is a  five-star book  from beginning to end"", 'while i am more associated with mystery and adventure novels than anything else, i read and read.  and on my website, polly whitney\'s book is among my five favorites ever.  truth is the only societal comparison to it that i can find is ""catcher in the rye,"" and graceanne is a far better book and a far better character to spend time with.  holden caufield consumed his day pissing and moaning while  graceanne spends her time enduring and conquering.  i have loved this book since the day my favorite editor, ruth cavan, sent it to me for a christmas present...do yourself a favor, get graceanne\'s book and it will soon be not just her book, but your book too.  simply a remarkable work of art.', 'The book is an easy read but it is a very complex structure. The style is fascinating. I found the book in a small ad in a local bulletin. It is a gem and the author lives right in my neighborhood. From the fisrt page, the reader is captivated by cascading words, thoughts, emotions. Yet every word is heavy with meanings and symbols, every emotion is pure and contained. I just love the novel. I hope the book will find its way into libraries and will be used as text book.']";The story is told by a nine-year old boy, Charlie, who observes with an encompassing awe a pivotal year in the life of his older sister Graceanne. She's loud, intellectual and a ruthless physical and psychological daredevil, a girl whose ferocious exploits are the stuff of local legend and the stuff of all that Charlie aspires to be. He narrates Graceanne's painful passage into teenage, a passage made tempestuous by their violent mother.  Read more

The story involves two women who were supposedly bff's in college and then don't see each other until they're approaching forty.  I found the whole idea bizarre, that they would suddenly want to go to Hawaii together after years apart.  They actually had nothing in common; one was a naive mother (and expecting another baby), who was savvy enough to own her own baking business, but surprisingly dense about alot of other things.  I was astounded that she had never had a manicure or pedicure, got hopelessly confused by how to apply sunless tanning products and had never tried sushi, etc, etc.... She is constantly putting herself down and comparing herself to her more sophisticated friend. Meanwhile, her buddy lives in an enormous house, is married to a world renowned artist, loves to drive fast cars, dress gorgeously and shop.  What was more troubling is this woman's desire to become an artist herself (photography) and she's afraid to tell her husband.I read it in one day, it's very light, easy to read.

The author states that she worked from Anna's own memoirs; unfortunately more recent research proves that she re-invented herself significantly through these works; thus her girlhood in Wales, her first visit to Bombay aged 15, so well described in Ms Landon's work, are in fact totally fallacious - she was born in India of mixed-race parentage.This was quite an interesting read if a little two-dimensional. Anna and her son arrive in a totally alien world: a world of wives and concubines shut up in a harem, where disobedience can result in torture or death. Over it all rules King Mongkut, last of the old style kings, under whom slavery is a fact of life, and where those approaching him are expected to prostrate themselves.Anna is throughout a heroic character, able to stand up to her unpredictable and capricious King, as she intercedes for concubines who have fallen foul of him. She doesn't entirely ring true; but I was entertained and educated nonetheless as Ms Landon describes ceremonies and state affairs, amuses with reproductions of the King's distinctive letters in English and keeps us on edge with tales of prisoners awaiting their fate. And her pride in her best pupil, Prince Chulalongkorn, under whose rule later on slavery would be eradicated.OK but in retrospect I'd probably go for a more factually correct account of Anna Leonowens' life such as 'Bombay Anna'."", ""I'm glad to have read this wonderful book. It has had me fighting back tears, wide-eyed in awe, and laughing out loud in equal measure. Some of the descriptions are rather lengthy, but necessary to give scale and perspective to the claustrophobic feel of life cloistered within the palace confines where the narrative takes place.I'm not surprised that the Siamese authorities of the day, did all in their power to try to suppress publication of Anna's own memoirs as governess to the royal children, and wives.  Readers will make up their own mind about the King. I think he was a terrible cruel despot, even by the standards of his time.The descriptions of regional and global political manoeuvres surrounding the characters are quite an eye opener too. The superpowers of the day were squabbling and struggling to expand their influence in the region, which makes for an interesting backdrop to the story of Anna and the King.

It was great to witness everything going on in her life over such a long span of time. I didn't want to miss one single of her thoughts. Because even though I am not a teenager anymore, it felt so good to read on page what makes these years so angstful and exciting at the same time.Every character contributes to the masterpiece of fun and hilarity -without ever forgetting that there's also the serious side of life- the Jessica Darling series stands for. I loved them all! Marcus Flutie, Jessica of course, her best friend Hope, the parents, her sister and her niece, to name only a few.Marcus Flutie is the main love interest and an extreme case of changeability. It's obvious that he hasn't found his place in life yet, always restless, always changing his mind and his heart about his future, his goals and even Jessica. I'd subtitle this series 'The metamorphosis of Marcus Flutie'. Alternative and surely not mainstream, he always seems to be on an experimental trip. We don't get him more often than we do, but when we connect, it's in all the right ways.Jessica is witty and her humour is the best. I laughed, I cried. I can’t believe how she always said and thought exactly what I was thinking. I wish I read this series much sooner. A revelation to every young adult reader!Jessica and Marcus make mistakes, get together, seperate again. Life comes in the way, wrong decisions play a part. It's just too much to point out every turn their relationship or lives make. There are so many scenes that need to be all time favourites! You. Yes. You. Marcus Flutie you stole my heart.The first two books SLOPPY FIRSTS and SECOND HELPINGS are about Jessica's time in high school.We are very lucky, because Jessica is keeping a diary. And the writing is as appealing as it is, because the story is written in the style of numerous diary entries. It has a very personal character and feels like we are just inside her head, going through everything she experiences and feeling as much love for Marcus Flutie as she does. Her writing is changing over the course of the series, especially in the fourth book, which is great, because it's a fab way to express change in her person or her ways of thinking.This series is a guide for all young, sarcastic, lovable and insecure girls out there!

Davis, the author of ""Girls\' Poker Night"" is a television writer from New York City, where her most famous gig was as a writer for the Late Show with David Letterman. If you didn\'t know that, you could almost guess at it from the irreverent and cynical sense of humor used on and by Davis\' heroine, Ruby Capote. Ruby\'s a writer who uproots herself from Boston to New York, leaving life with her compulsive boyfriend to find new experiences in the ""big city"". How to start feeling at home in New York? Start a Poker Night for old college friends to revive the social life. The story revolves around the Poker Night discussions, but is told in the form of short, brief spurts of whatever is on Ruby\'s mind at the time, much like her fictional columns on being single.Now, I know this already sounds like ""Sex in the City"", but Ruby and company are far more enjoyable than the ladies on TV. Their finances are more realistic, and their conversation runs the real gamut of the mix of compassion and gossip that women use when they are together. In the mix of these women\'s lives are the trials and paths that we all must face and decide whether to fold or to continue to hang in there. In the mix of their personalities is the humor and self-deprecation that bonds women together over many years - this is where the group most closely resembles Carrie & Co.Ruby needs her friends, but more than that, she needs to understand herself, and stop running away from who she really is, stop covering up her insecurities with brittle humor. The best and brightest part of the story is woven through the chapters, as Ruby comes to terms with the fact that she\'s found love, despite herself. And with the romance comes her ability to see herself as she really is, and to start enjoying what makes her the special person she is. This may be one of the best books ever written about the feeling of falling in love, the vulnerability and the heartache and insecurity. But in spite of all that, ""Girls\' Poker Night"", in spots, will make you laugh out loud, because Ruby really has a way with a story! Enjoy her tale of the Cuban cabdriver, Psychic Randy, and why Doug drove her crazy, but most of all, enjoy rooting for Ruby to make that big leap of faith into believing in herself!', 'As a guy reading this book, I felt like I was being privileged to watch Jill Davis\'s collection of babes from behind a one way mirror. And don\'t let anyone tell you that this is just a ""girl\'s book."" There may be some guys that get uncomfortable as they read it as they may see themselves in some of the male characters. But this book revolves around Ruby Capote\'s friends that gather once a week to ostensibly play poker and talk about...what else... their love lives or lack thereof...sexual orientation...aspirations...disappointments...the usual stuff we guys always assumed they talked about when we weren\'t around.It\'s a funny trip, although I thought it got a bit bogged down toward the end with the relationship that she pursues in Ruby-like fashion through most of the book. An excellent first novel by this new author.', ""I've read this book twice now. I didn't mean to re-read it; I'd forgotten the title and picked it up to escape a disappointing book. But even though I realized I had already read this, I continued because the plot wasn't really the driving force, no urgent need to know what happens. It was how Ruby, the main character, changed over the course of the book that was the point. Witty, not hilarious -- a quiet, good read.""]";Dissatisfied both with writing a “Single Girl on the Edge/ Ledge/Verge” lifestyle column and with her boyfriend (who has a name for his car and compulsively collects plastic bread ties), Ruby Capote sends her best columns and a six-pack of beer to the editor of The New York News and lands herself a new job in a new city. In New York, Ruby undertakes the venerable tradition of Poker Night—a way (as men have always known) to eat, drink, smoke, analyze, interrupt one another, share stories, and, most of all, raise the stakes.

It has a different story line from ""Carrie Pilby,"" although both deal with heroines who feel out of place, but for very different reasons.  ""Starting From..."" has the author\'s trademark probing questions, depth, and sharp insights into human behavior.  That\'s what I liked about the novel--that the heroines are deep, thoughtful, and somewhat unique characters.  I thought her two best friends represented a certain kind of female that is rather shallow and whose entire existence revolves around snagging a man, being popular, looking good, etc.  I couldn\'t really see what the main character had in common with these girls she considered her close friends.  I thought that for Geri, finding a second love came a little too easily.  Yes, she suffered over Marc\'s death but the message seemed to be that by being good and being true to yourself, eventually, true love will come.  All in all, a good read by a very thoughtful author.', ""Considering that the book was about a young widow, I expected this novel to make me cry.  It didn't.  Some parts of the plot actually felt rushed, but clearly all the ingredients were there.  I love stories about love, and they are rarely this thoughtful and honest. Even better, it isn't just about romantic love, but also about friendship, holding on, letting go, appreciating what you have. All the characters are real, complicated, and human-- there is no villian.  That was also refreshing. If I hadn't already read CARRIE PILBY, I think I would have been more than satisfied, but expected a lot from the author of CARRIE PILBY.  STARTING is not as original or surprising, but the thoughtfulness, the realness -- the down to earth truth -- is still here.  I don't think that this manuscript was really ready to go, but I enjoyed it nevertheless, and I still plan to read whatever Caren Lissner writes next."", 'This was definitely no Carrie Pilby, but I did greatly appreciate this book for its unique storyline. I enjoyed reading this book and being drawn into the main character\'s return to the world of dating after such a tragedy. (However, the FIRST guy she says ""Hi"" to become the new long-term boyfriend? Seems a little bit of a long-shot to me). Regardless, I thought it was smart and sensitive, unlike anything else out there. I have to give the book a rating of only 3 stars though for a few reasons. 1. the author overuses ""said"" so much it becomes annoying and distracting. ""Gert said. Hallie said. Then Todd said. etc. etc. etc."" all the way down the page! Ahh! Her editor should have told her to switch it up now and then with other words - explained, stated, contemplated, or announced for instance. Geez! 2. This is the fourth book in a row I\'ve read that has incorporated Sept. 11th into the plot. How come every book that has NYC as a setting lately feels the need to incorporate this in there some way?!?! Again, annoying and sadly, becoming cliche.

This book revolves around the murder of a bestselling author right before he was going to leave Japan with his new wife to Canada and also right before the publication of his another book. The infamous detective soon arrives in the crime scene, and within few days he suspects the best friend of the author to be the killer behind the author's death.Synopsis:Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally murdered in his home on the night before he's planning to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver. His body is found in his office, a locked room, within his locked house, by his wife and his best friend, both of whom have rock solid alibis. Or so it seems.At the crime scene, Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga recognizes Hidaka's best friend, Osamu Nonoguchi. Years ago when they were both teachers, they were colleagues at the same public school. Kaga went on to join the police force while Nonoguchi eventually left to become a full-time writer, though with not nearly the success of his friend Hidaka.As Kaga investigates, he eventually uncovers evidence that indicates that the two writers' relationship was very different that they claimed, that they were anything but best friends. But the question before Kaga isn't necessarily who, or how, but why. In a brilliantly realized tale of cat and mouse, the detective and the killer battle over the truth of the past and how events that led to the murder really unfolded. And if Kaga isn't able to uncover and prove why the murder was committed, then the truth may never come out.Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga is assigned on the murder case of the popular Japanese fiction author, Kunihiko Hidaka. On the crime scene, he is surprised to find his old college-cum-teaching-mate, Osamu Nonoguchi, who claims that he is the best friend of the deceased author and have found himself in the crime scene along with the author's new wife. Kaga's quest and later investigation soon places Nonoguchi as the prime suspect, but going back into the past of the two friends reveals a different relationship between the two authors than Nonoguchi claims to be. But why did the prime suspect kill an innocent author? Can Kaga reveal the truth?Well this is the first time that I ever read any book by Higashino, and I've only heard good things about him and his books. But very unfortunate to say that I found his book very dull, monotonous and predictable. Crime fiction being my favorite genre, I take the books of this genre pretty seriously, and I was very much surprised after the end of the book that this one turned out to be so much disappointing, where a regular reader like me could easily guess out the whodunit and the reason behind it, but the author has tried to twist the reason so much, that in the end I felt confused.The author's writing is really emphatic, yet it has too much depth, maybe over depth that mars the overall charm and intrigue of the story. Being a thriller/crime fiction, tension should have been a key ingredient of this book, but there was neither any tension, nor any major twist that will leave the readers in awe. The narrative of the book not only reflects the local Japanese dialect with its proper translation into English, but the author has managed to make it quite arresting, yet if the plot lacks from any suspense, then even if the narrative is engaging, the readers won't manage to find any interest. The pacing is very, very slow, I do not know, how I finished reading despite of the constant torture.The mystery lacked depth and closure, mid way through the book, I expected that the killer would be someone else, as the detective kept going back to the core of the two characters, and coming back with failed results. The mystery could have been much more well-developed with fast pace and more unexpected twists and turns.The characters are honestly way too boring and lacked dimension or layers to view them as otherwise. Besides the main character, Kaga, the rest of the characters could not leave an impression in the minds of the readers. Kaga is an exceptional and smart-witted hero and he is the one factor that makes the story so compelling to read. His notes and his mindset works so intelligently yet his demeanor reflects of no such brilliance, he projects as someone simple yet clever.In a nutshell, this is the last time that I bought any book by this author and I would suggest the hardcore crime fiction fans to skip this book, otherwise, if you're looking for a light thriller, then go for this one."", 'What a read. I Thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the writing, it keeps you hooked to till the end. Definitely worth reading.', 'This is the first book I\'ve read from the author.(PS: I\'ll try to make this as spoiler free as possible,  though may seem inevitable at times. )The book starts off great. A classic, closed room murder mystery with 2 main suspects with rock solid alibis. The very detailed descriptions hook you in, right off the bat!As the storyline progresses with narratives from different perspectives,  the anticipation builds up.But the end is disappointing. My reasons for this being:The main recipe for the crime is essentially a ""just because"". But to establish this very essence of a seemingly futile yet fundamental flaw in the protagonist, the effort and the descriptions are missing.  The author builds up the expectation to a monologue explaining this fundamental flaw and the weight of it (atleast) either from the perspective of the murderer or the detective,  but it doesn\'t happen.  We\'re given a very one dimensional ending, which seems very haphazard and out of order from the entire buildup of the book (right from the start). It\'s not just one dimensional,  it\'s also essentially one directional as well. Because the unusually perceptive and keen observer Inspector Kaga, at the finale just makes a very straightforward commentary without interjecting it with his observation of the murderer and his reaction. This seems very unlikely to the buildup of the character of Kaga.The event of the bullying is an essential factor to the whole plot . The inspector\'s own account of coming face to face with such a situation is what gave him an impetus and an intuition to crack the case. Yet the account of the complicated event is never fully described. Even from the numerous third party entries, the event remains unclear despite being the most focal point. Same goes for the photograph.In conclusion: the end  seemed hurried and lacking the gusto and engagement unlike the start of the novel. Maybe some parts have been lost in translation.Looking forward to reading more from the author in the future.']";Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally murdered in his home on the night before he's planning to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver.

Not only writes in it, is the doyenne of the genre. I have been a huge fan since I first borrowed a copy of Light A Penny Candle from my mother’s book shelf in my late teens. From that very first reading, I fell in love with her writing. Her gimlet eye for human nature. Her empathetic portrayal of emotion and the intimate frailties of the lives of real people. Her vivid portrayals of daily life in rural Ireland from the 1950s until modern times, and particularly the lives of Catholic women. Her books are a masterclass in how to write women’s fiction, and I am a true disciple, as my Maeve Binchy shelf will attest. I once saw someone dismiss her writing as ‘chicklit.’ Leaving aside the hot debate about the use of this intentionally derogatory term for books that are enjoyed by millions of women – and men – the world over, to label her work as chicklit is to fundamentally misunderstand it.IMG_3145Of all of her wonderful books, Circle of Friends has always been my favourite. It had a big impact on me when I first read it, and that impact has not lessened over the dozens of re-readings I have made of this book over the years, including the latest. The story still moves me emotionally, draws me in to its world and holds me in its grasp until the very last page, even though I know what is coming and how it ends. The ability to do this, to include layers of complexity and feeling so that the reader is held in thrall every time is a rare and beautiful skill that she possessed in boatloads and is the reason that her books have been bestsellers for decades, and are still popular many years after her death. Even now, new stage adaptations of her books are being written to delight audiences who can’t get enough of her intimate portrayals of women.This book tells the story of the friendship of Benny Hogan and Eve Malone as they grow up as children in rural Ireland in the 1950s and eventually leave their small town to go to university in Dublin, and how the contrast between the small, safe childhoods they have known and navigating the expanded world of college, new friends and the city, impacts them individually and as friends.Ireland, a strict Catholic country in the 1950s, held specific difficulties for women, but also the same challenges that we have faced the world over for centuries and, how the two girls navigate these challenges and support each other at the same time is at the core of the book and what will speak to women reading this book everywhere. Many of the issues that Maeve addresses are universal and will inevitably lead to the reader being able to identify with at least one of the characters in the book or one of the situations they have to face. Female friendship is an enduring topic in women’s literature, and one that is at the centre of many of Maeve’s books, and this one in particular.Benny Hogan is one of my favourite ever characters in a novel, and one I always have, and still do, identify with strongly. The author does such an amazing job of portraying her insecurity and vulnerability through childhood and into her teenage years that I defy anyone not to be firmly on her side from the beginning of this book, not to see some aspect of themselves and any fear they have ever had about their place in the world reflected back at them. This then makes Benny the perfect character to draw us in to this story of a young, gauche girl trying to navigate the new and intimidating world of university, far away from home and all the security she has known. These are emotions that most of us can relate to in one way or another and, as such, it is impossible not to celebrate her successes in this new world and suffer her heartbreak at the same time she does. This book takes me back to my teenage years, the overwhelming emotions that you feel falling in love for the first time, how one person can come to mean everything to you and that relationship, the tornado of feelings that are unleashed and seem uncontrollable, how the end of the relationship feels like the end of the world; I remember it all and relive it again through the pages of this book.Maeve’s writing is so tender and knowing, she really understands what makes people tick and is able to portray this in a way that makes us understand it too, but effortlessly, so you can’t even see how she is doing it. The lives of these women, their relationships and the settings of the stories come alive on the page, it is like watching a technicolour movie, and you can’t even see the joins. She writes the way I want to write, and I have spent a lot of time looking at how she does it, in the vain hope I can emulate her to some small degree. There was a discussion in my writing circle only yesterday about describing settings in books, how to do it vividly but discretely. Anyone wanting to see how it is done could do a lot worse than reading this book.Maeve’s work led me on to reading a lot of other Irish writers who quickly became huge favourites of mine, Marian Keyes and Cathy Kelly to name but two, and on to people such as Veronica Henry and Erica James, who also write this genre similarly beautifully and who are all heroes of mine.

Angus MacGillviray has returned from the Crusades, missing an eye, his body marked by the tortures he endured, and suffering from PTSD.  On returning to his home, he finds that his parents and brother are dead and someone else has taken over their holdings.  The priest who has the holding refuses to accept that he is the rightful heir and he barely escapes with his life.  He then kidnaps a young woman on her way to a convent in an ill-conceived plot to regain his heritage.

Jacqueline pleads that she is not the woman he believes her to be and that in fact Cormac MacQuarrie is dead. Angus's companion, Rodney, tries to persuade Angus to let the girl go and forget this plan but Angus states he will keep Jacqueline for the ransom that her father will give. Angus has been gone for fifteen years on crusade, many believed him to be dead. None of his family still live, but he is determined to regain control of his home, Airdfinnan, and nothing will dissuade him. Jacqueline fears Angus at first and not because of his many scars left from being imprisoned and tortured; but she begins to try and see the man beneath and understand his pain.She decides that she must help convince him to turn from his life of banditry. To be sure, she is a very curious person and continually asks questions that Angus refuses to answer but her wit, concern and perseverance begin to pierce some of the hardness in Angus.

Good! A comfortable, cozy bed? Splendid! A sweet little company – say of around 10 to 12 years of age? Perfect! Now we are ready to start ….Lay down together, cover yourself upto waist, then take out … Oh! Sorry, I forgot! We need another thing – Bill Watterson’s collection of Calvin and Hobbes comic strips. Armed with all these now you can lose yourselves in an hour full of chuckles and tickles – in short most satisfying wholesome entertainment.I know there are some frowns (from those who are uninitiated to the deadly duo) and a few knowing smiles (those who are already a part of Calvin & Hobbes fan club). Rest assured, you are not going to be disappointed whichever group you belong to. Popularity of Calvin & Hobbes comic strips is already legendary – its fans range from eight to eighty, scholars to vagabonds, reader of philosophy to appreciator of slapstick comedy.A six year old child with explosive vocabulary and his play mate (a stuffed tiger) – these are the main ingredients of the recipe. The child’s parents and a friend who happens to be a girl (not a girlfriend, mind you) almost completes the cast. With these limited resources the author creates a magical world. From first to last you will empathize with the child and his frustrations at the world around him for he is giving voice to your own unexpressed (or even forgotten) disappointments. Sometimes he will go over the top but even then you will feel like applauding rather than criticizing. And then there are his imaginative escapades – sometimes he is a valiant spaceman at others devastating T-Rex (just to give couple of examples) – you too will be carried back to your daydreaming days when the world at large seemed to have conspired to ‘get you’ and you, the lone man (or woman) standing, are valiantly meeting all adversaries singlehandedly. Frequently, there will be philosophical anecdotes – moments of truth which the perceptive eye of a child catches oftener than our logical mind.Few lines about the side cast. The parents play their part to perfection and sometimes they get to deliver smart one-liners but oftener they are outwitted by their six year old menace and then, exasperated, they are left to wonder whose chromosomes are at fault. Then there are babysitter named Rosalyn (some of the most titanic battles are fought with her), Teacher named Mrs Wormwood (often condemned to play the role of monster alien), a school bully (all brawn and no brain) and the school principal. But it is ultimately left to a cute little girl named Susie to occasionally give our hero hiccups but then he gets back with some innovative lunch packs.By the time you have finished, wiped out your moist eyes (from rows of laughter), left the bed and decided to give some attention to other practical affairs of life, I am sure you are thoroughly refreshed. The child with you too must have had a grander time and would definitely urge for a few more minutes of joint of shared reading. Try to give him or her those minutes (and need I mention, yourself too) for such minutes are much more precious than ones spent in front of laptops or flattering your bosses.', 'The book was delivered in perfect condition and has very good binding.As for the book content, well, I could keep singing its praises the whole day. The book is funny, sweet, thought-provoking.. I could keep going. Go for it.', 'Calvin and Hobbes is a timeless joy to read'];Calvin, cheeky, hyperactive and mischievous, and Hobbes, his cuddly toy tiger who, as far as Calvin is concerned is very much alive and kicking, are two of the most loveable and hilarious characters to grace the comic strip in years.This collection contains Yukon Ho! and Weirdos from Another Planet as an omnibus edition, but also a story that has not been in print before.

Has a real sense of the horror of the Civil War mixed with a serial killer thriller.', 'I really enjoyed this book for various reasons. Giving it 4 stars.One reason was the fact it was written in an unfamiliar dialect. The story was told in first person by a Welshman. The author used distinct cliques that I perceive to be specific to a particular area of the world or time frame. I\'ve grown extremely fond of the phrase ""let that bide"" which to me was another way of saying ""let that go.""Another favorite for me is, ""Whenever things go awry, see. In plague or war or what have you. Instead of rolling up their sleeves, they call for a messiah. It makes of Jesus no more than the world\'s mechanic."" kindle location 3567For whatever reason I found the peculiar dialect to be a refreshing change.The story opened up in the middle of a war. Carnage and blood were trivial attributes the author used to describe the scene. Which brings me to another reason why I liked this story.  The tale of how ants saved Jones life and the desperate attempt at survival displayed in the eyes of soldiers as described in this book added humanism and empathy for those in the middle of combat.Abel Jones, the Welshman, could not stay his derriere out of trouble. His encounters with the renegades of the south would add, for some, an emotional sourness for southerns as they cheer Abe through his journey.The investigation of the murders of 40 Negros was not high on the list of permissible acts. But the author made it the focus of the entire story. Through his direction, the incorporation of slavery, Christianity and cultural diversification created a well told fictional piece.I\'ve found a new respect for those that fight in war, regardless of the type of war, the demons are real. They emerge in various forms and justify their existence.', ""I'm always wary of historical novels, since they have a tendency to transfer 21st Century sensibilities to their subject matter. Owen Parry (whose real name is Ralph Peters, the great Russian expert and strategic thinker) avoids that, creating a hero and a story which live and breath the Civil War era. I was impressed, although not overly so, with the first book of the series, but I am increasingly moved by every addition to the series.Major Abel Jones is pompous and priggish and if weren't so clever in solving murder mysteries, he would be a classic comic figure (one on-going theme is the pride this Welshman takes in his singing voice, when it's obvious (though not to him) that it's rather awful).The walk on parts of various historical figures is impressive. I always judge the walk ons in historical novels by using as my gold standard the Abraham Lincoln in George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series: lovely little vignettes which both capture the essence of the man and allow the reader to see his hero in a new light. In River Jordan, Parry manages a General Grant who is every bit as real as Fraser's Lincoln.

Owen Parry has filled this void with Faded Coat of Blue.  This is a delightfully charming book that doesn\'t gloss over the dark side of war.Abolitionist and Army Captain Anthony Fowler is found murdered on the edge of an army encampment near Washington DC in the early days of the war.  General George McClellan chooses unsuspecting clerk, Captain Abel Jones, to investigate the murder.  Jones is a transplanted Welshman who has already seen warfare in India as part of the Queen\'s army.  Coming to the US for a better life, he finds himself pulled into the Civil War.  Jones can best be described as a plodder. He is not a brilliant man, but a loyal, fair and deliberate one.  He has strong Christian values and tries to live his life by them.  Jones latches on to this murder inquiry and refuses to let up-even when he discovers the disturbing truth, his life is threatened and his superiors call him off the case.Parry is a master at making us feel that we are living during the 1860\'s.  He fills his book with enough historical fact to be convincing, and has thoroughly researched such topics as The Civil War, the military, immigration, prostitution, disease, food, clothing and general conditions at this point in time.  One of the best parts in this book is a conversation that takes place between Abel Jones and Abraham Lincoln.  Although such a conversation is totally fictional, Parry has enough knowledge of Lincoln to write a dialogue that could have actually passed from Lincoln\'s lips.But what makes this such a charming and delightful book is Jones himself.  Written in the first person, Jones speaks with the rich and lyrical language of a man from Wales.  I will admit that it took me a chapter or two to grow accustomed to this style of speech.  But once I did, I was smitten.  Jones is also a keen observer of human nature, and some of his observations are priceless.  A few that caught my eye include:""War disappoints long before it kills.""""The wickedest place in hell should be reserved for those who paint war in glory and cause young men to dream of it.""""There is too much puffery and pretense in a novel for me.  It is very much a lady\'s province, and I always suspect the men who write the things of unsound habits.""Abel Jones is sometimes a little too rigid and self-deprecating to a fault.  But he is an endearing character, nonetheless.Faded Coat of Blue is a book that I hated to see end.  But the good news is that Parry is making the exploits of Abel Jones into a series, and Call Each River Jordan, Shadows of Glory and Honor\'s Kingdom have already been published.  They have definitely been added to my reading list.', ""Anthony Fowler is a young man from a wealthy upper-class Philadelphia family.  He has become nationally known and admired for his passionate campaign against slavery.  When the Civil War begins, he is of course among the first to join the Union army.  But one night he is found mysteriously shot dead on the edge of a military campground. Captain Abel Jones, the main character of this novel, is appointed (much to his surprise) by General McClellan to solve the mystery of Fowler's murder.  It doesn't take long for Jones to discover that Fowler's death was no random military casualty.  He was murdered elsewhere and the body dumped where it was found. Jones, a rigidly patriotic, religious, and somewhat self-righteous character, begins to uncover the facts, layer by layer.  Each layer moves the guilt another step higher in political and social circles, and soon Jones is treading on dangerous ground indeed. By the description above, this could be an ordinary mystery.  But at the same time that he is giving us a captivating mystery, Parry provides a vivid and convincing portrait of Washington and Philadelphia of the Civil War era.  The book includes an afterword by the author, discussing his research and the few minor cases in which his story deviates from strict historical accuracy.  He also recommends several references for those who are interested in more background material. The book succeeds on every level.  Jones and his supporting cast are well-drawn characters with whom the reader is happy to spend time.  The history is enriching, and the mystery itself is solidly crafted.  Everybody should like this one."", ""I purchase and read many, many kindle books. But I don't leave many reviews. I was just never one to take much time to sit down and write reviews. I would read the books, then pull up another one to get started on, and after getting into the new one, it just seemed too late to review the previous book. This one, however, is different. I'll be brief. This is one of the finest works of fiction that I have ever read. Great story, very, very well written, and fantastic characters. This author is gifted. And for the first time in quite awhile, I find myself actually wondering about the characters from a book that I finished reading over a week ago. I guess I'm still rooting for Captain Jones and sort of hoping that he's doing okay. Now, I understand that might sound sort of corny, but I don't care. It's the truth.

So they call 911. And Mike Perry, along with a handful of other stalwart volunteer EMTs and firefighters answer those calls.Perry grew up in New Auburn, and like so many young people who spend their childhood in rural areas, left as soon as he could. After earning his nursing degree and working elsewhere for a dozen years or so, he made his way back to hometown where most of his family still lives.And then he joined the volunteer firefighters, working alongside his mom and brothers.This book is an extraordinary tale of answering 911 calls from the rescuer's point of view, as well as the joys of living in a very (very) small town. And it's fascinating! It's also scary, a bit gruesome (some chapters are not for the faint of heart) and heartwarming. (And the ending is heartbreaking.) Thank goodness there are people like Michael Perry who put their lives on the line for the rest of us. And thank goodness he can come home, fire up his computer and tell us all about it. Highly recommended!"", ""I bought this book on a lark after seeing Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver fame) recommend it to someone on twitter. It's outside of the usual genres I read and I didn't really know what to expect but I found myself amused, touched, enlightened, and constantly surprised at every turn of the page. Michael Perry has a way with words that's intellectual without being academic or high-falutin'. He'll be talking about sitting in his LAY-Z-Boy picking the mud off his boots and suddenly throw out a word you have to look up (I say that as someone with a pretty substantial vocabulary) then draw some parallel to something Edgar Allen Poe once said. He constantly surprises you like that. He's very easy to read though. He's also hilarious. It's usually not even what he says, but how he says it that had me in stitches half the time. It honestly takes a lot for something to make me laugh out loud but I actually had to quit reading this at night when my roommates were trying to sleep because my uproarious laughter woke them up so much. Michael Perry is now one of my top 3 favorite writers. It doesn't matter what he's writing about, it's always entertaining. If you like this book I highly recommend you read his book Truck as well. Before Michael Perry I never would have imagined myself reading a book about someone restoring an old truck, AND loving it so much that I limited myself to only a few pages a day, so it wouldn't end so soon. If you're expecting a book all about being an EMT or how to survive small-town life, it might not meet those expectations, but you will enjoy it anyway.

So much so that when he first visited my hometown, he used his habitual morning walks to explore various parts of the locality. Like most Indians of his generation, he had never stepped out of his home state till then. So, when he visited the southern part of the country for the first time, he was excited by all the sights he witnessed – cows being milked on the streets, women adorning front yards with rangolis, temples and mosques opening in those wee hours for early morning prayers, restaurants offering fresh filter coffee, etc. Even now, years after that visit, he fondly recalls all those sights and speaks glowingly about the ancient traditions prevailing in my hometown.I often compare myself with him – a man of his age preferring to explore by walking around, in places he doesn’t know, amidst people that speak languages he doesn’t understand. Myself on the other hand, young and with energy, a polyglot to boot, preferring to use private vehicles or book taxis to move around in new places, going from one point to another, seldom stopping to breathe in all that is new and peculiar about that place. He is a traveler by heart, while I am an ordinary tourist, a stranger even in my own place, never having wavered from routes that took me to my college or office, never having seen a major part of my own hometown!The world, luckily for moored mortals like me, is filled with travelers like my father-in-law, people that step into the streets, take in all that smell and sights, get acquainted with the local customs and culture, be a part of the milieu and become one with it. Many such travelers have been able writers too, who could soulfully share their experiences so that people like me could feel a vicarious pleasure. William Dalrymple is one such traveler, an able historian and an interesting writer, full of anecdotes and cutting wit. When he writes a book about his first visit to Delhi, a city with a history that is as old as one of India’s greatest epics, if not more, you can expect it to be a great treat. And, a delight this turned out to be!First published in 1993, during a period when India was soaking up the effects of globalization and privatization, the book recounts Mr. Dalrymple’s arrival in India for the first time, along with his wife, and stay for about a year before his return to his homeland for a brief visit. The book contains two strands. One strand follows Mr. Dalrymple’s arrival, his experience with the prevailing bureaucracy, the quirks of Indians stuck in the transition from the so-far cloistered Indian society, marked by the docile Doordarshan, to the ‘liberal’ Western culture, epitomized by half-clad VJs of MTVs and V Channels. The strand is made colorful by the presence of some interesting characters. His flirtatious landlord and the mildly-grumpy-often-friendly landlady, Mr. and Mrs. Puri, Balvinder Singh the boisterous taxi driver and the ageing Islamic scholar Dr. Jaffery are some of the characters that add vibrant hues to this strand as it moves forward.The other strand travels in the opposite direction, drawing concentric circles in the sands of Time, tracing the history of Delhi backwards, starting from the British Raj and its gory legacy – the Partition of India. Moving backwards in time and moving across a few miles from the lush lawns of New Delhi to the dusty lanes of old Delhi, the second strand takes on hues of blood and tears, beauty and betrayal, vices and virtues. Detailing the now-fascinating, now-revolting Mughal history, describing the early days of sultanates, talking about the little-known Hindu kings like Anangpal Tomar, the book makes an ambitious effort at going all the way up to the pre-historic days of Indraprastha, the famed city of Pandavas, which stood in or around the area where modern Delhi now stands.While the strand that moves ahead in time is full of trademark wit and sarcasm, eliciting chuckles often, the strand moving backwards lends a sense of pathos. The glory of old Delhi, its current decay, the yearning for those days of regal grandeur, the revulsion one feels at the fratricides and parricides that stained Mughal history, the pride for some of the greatest monuments that adorn Delhi’s landscape, the helplessness with which we bid adieu to that glorious past that is being irretrievably lost – this book will take you on an emotional roller coaster.Interweaving these two strands, Mr. Dalrymple has produced a tapestry full of life and longing. As colorful as Delhi’s history, this is a must read for anyone in love with India, its heritage and history. Man, I felt a sigh and a tinge of sadness as I closed the book and kept it aside!AK.', 'It’s interesting book if you intend to know about Delhi city’s culture. I feel author is biased while comparing practices of two communities. For one particular communities’ practices he is full of praise and convinced about their superstition also e.g Jinns possessing body of a human. Author is praising unani method of treatment whereas ayurvedic treatment is considered as road side shanties. Further Mahabharat era is shown in a very de-glorified way as a war of people with sticks, rods and stones, its very disappointing.', ""Having liked Delhi in one of his travels during the 80s, William decides to move with his wife during the early 90s. In the next 12 months, we follow his life here amid interesting characters who introduce him to life in Delhi, as William traces back the deep history of this complicated city. The narrative is fascinating for it diverges further over time - on one hand, we live William's life in 1991, on the other, we go further back from Partition to British rule, then Mughal invasion, the Sultanate, the Chouhans, and finally to Indraprastha/Mahabharata.I must confess I was partial to the book because some descriptions reminded me of life growing up in the early 00s even though the book pre-dates my upbringing by a decade. I suppose most citizens enjoy a 'love to hate' sentiment with their cities. The idiosyncratic habits, customs, and colloquial phrases had me nodding and chuckling a fair deal. But unlike the sycophantic accounts of darbars in Mughal courts that William mentions, my praise is rationalized on the following -an ease of reading, the flow of his narrative, and the depth of William's exploration. Not only is it a well-written account, it's a well-lived account that required countless interactions with scholars, priests, enunchs, bureaucrats, senile Anglo-Indian women, drivers, and dozens of books, documents, and worn-down monuments that spread across centuries.Delhi is a palimpsest, writes William in an updated foreword, and I can't put it better. Time and again, this city has been built, pillaged, broken, and re-built. It's the Djinns love for the city that keeps it alive, mentions a Pir to William. I suspect the book is loved by them too for it has also endured.Arguably the best book I've read this year. Kudos to Mr. Dalrymple.""]";Delhi is a city like no other, one which, in spite of being as old as time, is culturally dominated by relatively new dwellers. Interspersed with accounts of meeting assorted Delhiwallahs including Sufis, eunuchs, Persian scholars and an Englishwoman who stays behind after the Raj's hasty exit, City of Djinns seeks out the essence of this ancient town in a travelogue like no other.

Not only is Dr Scarpetta back on the anti-social buffoon kick, this book is just plain stupid.Let\'s start Scrapetta\'s personality change. I don\'t know what happened. It actually felt like Scarpetta was working on being likeable a couple of books ago. Now, she\'s back to being unpleasant again. I have no idea why. Maybe Cornwell found it too hard to write. Whatever the reason, however, she back to being not very nice.Okay, so let\'s turn to plot now. Two books ago, we learn that Kay is a homewrecker. She\'s just had an affair Benton Wesley, whose wife has decided to leave him. He says his wife doesn\'t know about them, but then he\'s from money, so he probably would say that. Anyhow, they\'ve gone from secretive ""hot and horney"" to ""staid and boring"" in less that 2 books (so presumeably less than 2 year). That\'s never a good sign in a relationship.Secondly, plotwise, Lucy Farinelli (Scrapetta\'s neice) was a bit of an FBI ""girl wonder"", writing phenomenal computer programmes, while gearing up to be a wall scaling wunderkind. She too has changed. She\'s been bounced out of the FBI completely, and been moved to the ATF in Philadelphia. She\'s changed too. The experience has hardened her, while at the same time makes the reader think ""Wait what now?"" Doubly so because of the hardening of Lucy\'s personality.Thirdly, when it comes to the relationship between Farinelli and Scarpetta, there\'s this creepy scene between where Scarpetta realises that Farinelli has ""filled out, and grown up."" This can be fine, but it actually felt wrong here.Then it comes to the actual story. It actually felt like a hold over story. Someone gets killed in an arson. As the Scarpetta gang investigates, we find out more of their backstory, and discover how the back story relates to what happens in this book. This would be fine, but for the fact that it felt a like Conwell thought ""Oh that story I wrote a while ago. I\'m going to write a sequel to it. If you\'ve not read that book, it\'ll feel a bit bad though.""To make matters worse, the ending wasn\'t all that credible either. There was no reason for the baddies do what they did, except that I suspect that the read would have thought ""Oh for God\'s sake."" if it hadn\'t have happened.The worst part of the story, however, is what happened to Benton. Cornwell has a history of doing things to her characters, so this should come as no surprise to her readers. The big difference here was that I couldn\'t see a reason for it. With her other characters, there was some logic, but here, not so much. Oh, and another thing. She (Cornwell) bottled it. Maybe she got blowback from readers, but she finds ways to address what happens in later books.So, all in all, not good. I didn\'t enjoy it if you haven\'t guessed.', 'Definitely by far one of her best ones. It was riveting and the manner in which the killers completed their vicious crimes was so gritty you could feel the shock of the characters as if you were there. A hint of sadness mixed with a good showdown that finally came to a head and was a long time coming. Can not wait to read the next one to see how they cope in the aftermath.', 'I quite enjoyed the storyline, I am interested in forensics but the end is bordering on ridiculous. I think for a moment Patricia Cornwell morphed into Ian Fleming. I like James Bond as much as the next man, but didn’t expect to find him here.']";Carrie Grethen, partner in crime to William Temple Gault, has escaped from prison. Before she does so she sends Kay Scarpetta a message which makes it all too clear that she blames her (and Lucy, and Benton Wesley, and Pete Marino) for Gault's death, and has specific - if cryptic - plans for revenge. Wary and quite shaken, Scarpetta still has a professional life to get on with, including investigating the death of an unknown female in a fire which has destroyed the isolated farmhouse home of her erstwhile political boss. The post mortem reveals that the woman was stabbed

Rebecca's Tale is quite interesting as we get to learn about Rebacca's childhood. A very interesting read."", ""I read this novel after rereading 'Rebecca 'and reading Sally Beauman's essay appended to the Virago edition.  In her essay, Beauman puts forward some ideas about the novel, some of which I agree with, some i found rather doubtful, so I was interested in what kind of fiction she made out of her analysis of the original novel.Overall I think 'Rebecca's Tale' is a success but Beauman doesn't seem to quite make up her mind whether she is writing a gothic novel in the du Maurier style, or a feminist response to the novel (as 'The Wild Sargasso Sea'  is to 'Jane Eyre') or a detective mystery. For me it worked best as a mystery and I was kept guessing about the motives and identity of Mr Grey right up to the reveal.  After that point the novel seemed to run out of steam.  As a gothic novel, Beauman struggles to summon up the right atmosphere.  A superfluous and clichéd ghost, that fleetingly appears, only serves as a reminder that a true master of the genre does not need such props.The sexual politics is rather laboured in places.  A couple of new characters (i.e. not in the original novel)  have no necessary purpose in the story and appear to have been added just to reveal themselves as gay.  Nevertheless, I liked the feminist hero Ellie and I found her story very satisfying, even though it was tangential to the main plot.In her essay, Beauman suggests that Max de Winter's second marriage  is a 'mariage blanc' (without sex).  Personally, I don't think that is strongly supported by the text.  I do find the second Mrs de Winter in 'Rebecca' annoying, but despite that I was a little shocked at Beauman's portrayal of her in this novel which seemed unnecessarily cruel.  The problem with fan fiction, however literary, is that the readers will have their own ideas about the characters that they are already familiar with.  Beauman's Rebecca's backstory was very unlike any I have imagined for 'my' Rebecca, but that did not spoil the novel for me."", ""This must be one of the greatest spoilsport books ever written.  If, like me, you were completely captivated by Daphne du Maurier's magical, timeless tale, Do Not Read this Book.  Every character you liked or respected is torn to shreds, even the lesser characters.  It is only fit for burning.  I would have given it a minus 5 but such options were not available..

Any person interaction with animals would do well to read this book. Animal professionals must read it as it is a classic in the animal rights literature.Style and contentsAt about 250 densely packed pages, you won’t be done in a couple of days, but it’s no War and Peace either.The book is divided into 2 chapters examining widespread abuses by the research and intensive farming industries. It also devotes a couple of chapters to the philosophical arguments supporting the equal consideration of animals. Finally, one chapter covers tips and views on vegetarianism.The gemsThe book in itself is a gem. It is THE classic in the animal rights’ literature and is on every animal rights and bioethics course reading list. These were some of the tidbits that I found particularly interesting:  The chapters detailing the abuses of the research industry were shocking and depressing. Knowing what I know of ethics committees in the EU and UK protecting mammals at least (except rats and mice…), I think things have changed a lot there. Not enough, but a lot. Sadly, not much has changed in the intensive farming industry, where regulatory bodies are more committed to pleasing crowds than effective action.  His chapter on animal research gave me pause, particularly the species-specific idiosyncracies that are discovered after the fact again and again. Take the fact that morphine is a neurostimulant for mice (it is a neurodepressant for us)! Countless products have been tested on animals and have been revealed, come human trial times, to have paradoxical effects in humans. The fact that promising animal models have to be taken lightly was not news to me, but the book opened my eyes to the horrifying scale of the problem. A ‘sad tale of futility’, as he calls it.  His reviews of the futile psychology experiments also made for depressing reading: studies on maternal deprivation, stress, learned helplessness/experimentally induced neurosis are classics in our field. Little did I know that so many subsequent – and useless – variations were carried out, putting millions of animals through unspeakable suffering for no reason.  I loved the passages on influential thinkers’ views through the ages. Having taken my last history course on the topic ages ago, it was a welcome refresher on the views of Descartes, Montaigne, Rousseau, Hume, Bentham, Thomas of Aquina, etc.  I was surprised by the list of animal-based products. I had never stopped to consider whether my candles, soap bars and perfume bottles had been were ethically sourced. Like I needed something else to feel guilty about.  As a veggie, I am wary of having to justify my dietary choice all the time, particularly from people who imply you are an irrational softie for caring about killing animals. He has a great way around that. He just says he is boycotting the intensive farming products. Effectively, unless you are getting your animal produce from your cousin or your neighbour, it means you are a veggie.  It was interesting to see that these assumptions were STILL being made by many meat eaters and needed addressing…  That you supposedly need meat to live (patently untrue)  That all veggies oppose the killing of animals to eat (I certainly don’t. I oppose their life of suffering and painful death)  I liked that he called meat ‘flesh’. It is less easy to hide from the horrifying truth when you don’t use an impersonal word.  An interesting passage on plants and pain, and the methods used to gain our knowledge (neurology, evolutionary function and behaviour)Possible points for optimizationStupidly, I read the 1995 edition instead of the 2015 one. That’s how long it had been on my ‘to read’ shelf… So I don’t know whether what I point out below has drastically changed in the latest edition.  I found the chapter on vegetarianism out of place. It fell into prosaic topics like how easy it is for friends to accommodate for your change of diet and that really vegetarian recipes are more diverse, if anything, than ones based on meat. I am a veggie myself so this argument doesn’t come from some defense mechanism or anything. The chapter was simply not intellectually interesting – nor logically or factually rigorous.  The logic (and realities) underlying his equal consideration arguments was occasionally weak, and it was a little repetitive. This is disappointing considering he is a professional ethicist. Take these examples:  Comparing speciesm to racism doesn’t hold water not just in degree, but also in kind.  Dodgy logic (p. 92) arguing that relying less on experimentally induced disease (on animals) would have somehow changed the focus of medicine towards prevention and healthy living. Yes, it would have, as a necessity. Surely he is not arguing that we should forego researching treatments and ONLY focus on prevention? For every disease?  On p. 229, his logic becomes outright tortuous. This is the predictable product of hard utilitarianism.  He says that the only defense of speciesm (namely to privilege members of our own group), is unjustifiable. It only is if you are a hard-line utilitarian. Take the classic thought experiment where you know your brother is evading his taxes on a grand scale, and you are asked whether you would report him. Of course the circle of empathy rings deeper the closer the person is to our inner circle: immediate family, friends, community, country, species. Whilst I tend to abhore nationalism, I can still see the evolutionary function of this selective empathy along lines of closeness to oneself.  A couple of statements are factually incorrect.  On p. 222, for example, he claims that no other animal, aside from man, prolongs the suffering of their prey. I can think of two counter-examples in less than a second: cats and killer whales.  I was surprised that he did not mention cognitive dissonance. Sure (most of) his arguments supporting vegetarianism are sound (better ecologically, medically and ethically). But the problem isn’t the weight of the arguments, it’s cognitive dissonance. Meat eaters are so committed to the idea that any argument opposing their worldview will just entrench them further.  Whilst I also (still) eat eggs and drink dairy product, I am aware of my hypocrisy. He, on the other hand, conveniently breezed over the horror that is the egg and leather industries when discussing the impracticality of veganism and not wearing leather.  He does not condemn the free-range egg industry explicitly enough, nearly trivializing its abuses (male chicks are still crushed alive by the millions).The verdict:The book is a classic and must be read by every professional working with animals, and even by laymen.Sometimes his arguments smacked of post hoc rationalisations and got tangled up by his hard line utilitarianism, but the central point is valid: we should view speciesm critically (he would like us to condemn it altogether, which I find neither feasible nor desirable). We should grant animals equal consideration of interests.'];"“A most important book that will change the way many of us look at animals—and, ultimately, at ourselves.” — Chicago TribuneSince its original publication in 1975, this groundbreaking work has awakened millions of people to the existence of ""speciesism""—our systematic disregard of nonhuman animals—inspiring a worldwide movement to transform our attitudes to animals and eliminate the cruelty we inflict on them.In Animal Liberation, author Peter Singer exposes the chilling realities of today's ""factory farms"" and product-testing procedures—destroying the spurious justifications behind them, and offering alternatives to what has become a profound environmental and social as well as moral issue.

The plot revolves around Earnest Worthing, who is a lot of people—John, John's brother, and Algernon Moncrieff, but also nobody.Thinking what's going on? Bunbury!..What's that? It's an act of creating a fictitious scenario that provides an excuse for avoiding unwanted engagements. A lot of us have done that—haven't we?

Truth unveils like layers of an onion and it's hilarious...I especially liked Algy (Algernon). His conduct was absurd throughout, still entertaining as hell. The friendly banter between him and Jack aka John over muffins cracked me up. Also, not to forget Lady Bracknell's questions...🤣🤣..Even after all this, Wilde surprised me in the end.

It also has introduction by Margaret Atwood and David Bradshaw. Besides that the book is obviously a must read.', ""The title of the book is taken from a line in Shakespeare’s The Tempest – “O brave new world, that has such people in it!” – uttered by the character Miranda who has grown up in an isolated society and sees a large number of people for the first time. Huxley’s Brave New World is about the clash between the Miranda-like protagonist, John (who incidentally has read only Shakespeare while growing up), who lives in an isolated settlement, and a world where humans are engineered in labs to lead a perfectly contented life.The first third of the book describes the dystopian World State where everything, ranging from procreation to employment to recreation, is created and controlled artificially in line with its motto of “Community, Identity, Stability”. Humans are artificially produced in batches and divided into a caste system ranging from Alpha Plus to Epsilon Minus, conditioned from the embryo stage. They (including the lower castes) lead a happy life driven by technology, promiscuity and a drug called “soma” – overall a “civilized infantility” as Huxley puts it. Henry Ford seems to be the presiding god of this world, possibly in line with his famous assembly line system of manufacturing.The second part deals with the exploration of a “savage” settlement, where people live the old-fashioned way, by Bernard Marx (an Alpha Plus but one who does not wish to conform to the ideal world, like his friend Helmholtz Watson) and his date of the moment, Lenina Crowne. They meet John, a naturally created offspring of a senior functionary of the World State, but one who has grown up oblivious to it. The final part is about John, like Miranda, trying to blend in the World State and the inherent conflicts that it creates. The highlights of this part, in my view, are the discussions between John and Mustapha Mond, the controller. It’s about the eventual salvation of Bernard and Helmholtz and the only possible conclusion of John’s story.Brave New World, like 1984 published 17 years later, discusses a dystopian world and the perils therein. But the books’ approaches to this end are significantly different – the latter explores control through fear while the former sees pleasure as a tool for control. Brave New World is an interesting and short read about the clash between those who want to “get rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it” and others who would like to “claim the right to be unhappy”, while simultaneously discussing issues such as racism and casteism.It's easy to see that it would have been a radical book in 1932. It obviously is significantly less so today which makes this book seem obsolete at times. But if one can get past it or if possible, read this book through the lens of a 1930s reader, the book is an extremely interesting and rewarding read.Pros: Fascinating setting, using Shakespeare as an interesting metaphor, easy readCons: May seem a bit outdated now""]";Brave New World is a novel with a science-fiction theme written by bestselling author, Aldous Huxley, and was first published in 1932. It is set in the far future, in 2540 AD and features a utopian view of the society at that time, with a lot of material dedicated to sleep learning, reproductive technology, and classical conditioning. The title is derived from a line in Shakespeare’s The Tempest.The book begins with a lengthy introduction, detailing the author’s views of how he thinks the entire world will function in the far future, in a global society that he terms The World

It has immensely profound and mature themes embedded under the riveting epic that it is. Themes along the likes of institutionalized Religion, Politics, Environmentalism, human greed and Spiritualism. Over the years, readers of the book have been able to discern the parallels drawn to various real-world belief systems including Buddhism, Sufi Mysticism, Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism and Judaism.Frank Herbert, the author of the book noted in an interview that his Arab friends liked to call DUNE a religious commentary rather than science-fiction. Also, the story is heavily influenced by middle-eastern culture with Spice being a metaphor for Oil and Water for water itself. And the exploitations of regional societies and resources by Western Civilizations.DUNE is more than a coming of age tale. It teaches you about loyalty and courage and most importantly, how to conquer your fears. It\'s about the dark side of fanatic leadership and how unbounded power can corrupt even the most faithful of leaders. Moreover, It teaches people to think for themselves and the fallacy of following messianic figures blindly.The language of DUNE is complex, taking inspiration from multiple tongues including Arabic, Persian, East Indian and Old English which could make it a hard read for some people. However, The world-building in DUNE is vivid and immaculate making the reader to get lost in that world and if a fiction book is able to pull that off, it\'s no less than a masterpiece to me.DUNE is an immensely rich work written by a prolific writer who went on to write multiple other Dune books creating an unparalleled saga of Science-fiction Epic.

I had earlier ordered twice from different sellers, but received different products.', ""Who would have thought you could put Bernard Cornwell and bad book in the same sentence? Not me, that's for sure. I mean, this is Bernard Cornwell, the man who wrote the peerless Sharpe series. Sharpe!Rebel tells the story of Nathaniel Starbuck, a northerner who signs up with the southerners and fights for them in the American Civil War. The climatic battle of this novel is the first Bull Run (I didn't know there were more than one til I read this book). There are some very familiar Cornwell themes here, an outcast who becomes the hero, he has enemies on his own side, no one wants him to be an officer, and surprise surprise, he ends up in charge of the skirmishers. Oh, and he gets to boff a beautiful woman as well.Sounds like a winning combination. So what went wrong?Well, there is zero pace and a massive over description. To the point where I gave up on the narrative and just skipped to the dialogue. I still got the story, without the, well I have to say it, utterly boring prose. It really could have been cut by half (much like game of thrones). The scene with Nate's father is also very oddly placed, and after a few lines I skipped that as well. It was very unsatisfying to have to skim vast tracts of this novel, but it was that or not read to the end, which would have been akin to admitting defeat.I'm glad I read Sharpe before picking this up, because if I hadn't, on the strength of this novel, I wouldn't have gone near another Cornwell book, and to have missed out on Sharpe would have been to miss one of the joys of life. Sadly though, I'll not be following Starbuck any further.Other books you might like to read\nAn Angel's Alternative\n\nCold Steel on the Rocks\n\nWe Are Cold Steel"", ""Like many others, I found this slightly slow to start with while you get to know the characters, and Starbuck himself starts off as an unlikely hero. However it is well worth sticking with. As soon as the battles commence the book becomes totally absorbing, and I went straight on to the next 3 in the series immediately. The series as a whole I would definitely rate as 5 star, and needs to be read in order so as to appreciate the development of all the characters. Cornwell is an excellent writer, and has awakened in me a new interest in the Civil War where I've gone on to delve more into the history of some of the battles and events.Once you get into the character, Starbuck is every bit as interesting a hero as Sharpe, and the quality of Cornwell's narrative is superb.

What is it that arrests your attention? The concept of the plot or the narration?I’ve read several RK Narayan books over the years and loved most of what I’ve read. These books are like a life parallel to the one that flows alongside the reality, at the time I’ve read them. Though written long ago, these stories have a modern charm, seeking exploration in the plot through the mind and actions of the characters and a complementing landscape making them way ahead of the time they were written in.Having an affinity for the mundane and known makes me pick up an RK Narayan book every time I’m in a slump or a fix about my next read, and this experience brings a novel plot that is contemplative and uplifting.The Painter of Signs is another brilliant tale, of Raman, who is an artist or painter by profession. He paints sign-boards for a living and is a hardcore rationalist who plays his part in establishing “the age of reason” until he falls in love with who runs the government Family Planning Clinic in his town. Contrary to her delicate feminine name, Daisy is a woman on a mission, one who functions by the clock and not by emotions.Love is not a simple emotion and it’s reciprocation, even more difficult is what the reader explores through his journey with Daisy. Picturesque travels, a lovelorn male lead and his quest to get his true love to accept him make this book funny and empathizing.

Murakami leaves me asunder with his intense, passionate prose. He plucks threads from everyday and weaves it unapologetically into his surreal literature. There are so many knots that have been split apart and left untied in the span of these pages; I cannot wait to get to the other instalments in the upcoming months.Book 2 (2020)-Although I had forgotten quite a judicious amount of character sketches and the storyline, the story didn’t fail to amaze me even after two years. Bringing Aomame and Tengo back to life in this upside down world wasn’t difficult because Murakami’s writing had left an indelible mark right from the first book of this trilogy. On the one hand, Aomame’s life as an assassin continues as she prepares for one of her life-changing cases in this second book of the trilogy. On the other hand, unknown people start entering Tengo’s life as closer ones start to depart, he sees his life change; for better or worse, he is unable to figure out. When reading Murakami, it is better to not expect anything. And I mean it when I say anything, it may have no basis to the reality we are living at all. Peculiar characters, perplexing scenes rich with sex, and the ambiguous representation of our minds through magic realism. Murakami’s existentialist leanings takes the human mind and dissects it into mystifying fragments. When you feel he is trying to offer an explanation of a particular shingle, the author takes it back and knots it further into another neat bun of questions. I felt myself reading and reading and I realised I was getting drawn down into a vortex that kept asking questions and answered none. That could be what Murakami wants through the stories he writes, he wants us to have a look into our minds, notice its depth that will continue to go unravelled and dispute reason and logic to our personalities and outlook to life. I certainly can’t wait to read the last book and finish the series soon, hopefully before two years.Book3 (2022)- After 6 years, I can finally say that I have read 1Q84! I remember having begun it some time in mid-2018, thinking I'd finish it by the end of the year but two years went by until I picked it up again in the middle of the lockdown. I promised to pick it right up in 2021 but two years again passed until I was determined to open the last book and get done with it. And I did! I did not have a hard time getting back to the story. Call it the lasting impression of Murakami's writing, or my retentive memory; I was able to make my way through the last book without much trouble. The threads connecting Tengo and Aomame are finally finding ways to merge, to seek each other through hell and the unknown. And between them is Ushikawa, sharp, intelligent man with a misshapen head and an ugly face, he is determined to trace their steps and get answers for the many stones that have been left upturned throughout the first two books. Now, to be frank, I didn't have a tough time with the writing but I constantly felt myself feeling more and more alienated by his prose. Unlike my previous experiences with the writer, I wasn't charmed, or left spell-bound. It is sad to say but I failed to understand the point in the last instalment. I loved the scenes of everyday life he had conjured, of being alone in a flat, preparing your food, reading, sipping beer, missing a significant other and other such reassuring images of life that continued even when circumstances seemed anything but normal or mundane.  There were points that had me on the edge of my seat and I was flew through those parts but mostly, I was comforted and ensconced in the everyday life of the characters as they looked for answers. However, I do not think I was very happy and I think it's the problem with me and not Murakami. It's sad to keep realising, with every book, that I have outgrown him, and that it's good to part ways with him. My dear Murakami, you have been a good good friend, and you have bedazzled my youth but it's time for us to say goodbye. See you, soon, (maybe?)"", 'Im a Murakami fan, right from the day i first took Kafka on the shore in my hands. This is an incredibly awesome book. The reason i love Murkami a lot is, his way of writing is evocative, in a sense, even though the actual story is a fiction, you can still feel the events described in it, with a personal touch. I find him immensely interesting and it just keeps me in place for a long time. I love the sexuality exhibited in his writing. I enjoy it. Its a gift and he has a flair to toy with the emotions. Mind you, sexuality has been exhibited without or rather less inhibitions in Japanese culture, than other parts of the world. ( i tend to think about the author when he writes his piece and try to understand how and where his work or literature came to be)And now to the book, 1Q84 is just great! I was hooked from the moment i read the first chapter. And i always love his taste for music and i am indeed greatly moved towards music through his works. The story about two people said in a parallel perspective of their own lives, which will collide later undoubtedly. It hits all the right notes in both the characters. There are a slew of strong and expressive plot lines which grips you and keeps you rooted in your place. I am loving everything that is going on till now with the book. Its almost tantalizing to read his books.The book is long and i can understand why it is and i have no worries about it. The first and second books came out in 2009 and the third the next year. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to read a long book and still captivated by it. The language is simple and crisp, easy to understand for anybody, unlike Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has a penchant for expressive and complex language and at times a lil archaic, which is in its own way a beautiful masterpiece. It has a beautiful ambience to it. Go for it. Especially a Murakami fan should read it.And now for this book itself, its a good imprint. The font, spacing and size are all good. The cover of the paperback is thin, but it has held all the pages of the book intact. I have took it in trains and buses and it has been through all. The paper quality is good. No issues with it. Its a great work of fiction. Hope you too will have a good time as i had! Cheers!!!', ""Being a Murakami fan this became a must read for me. Whenever I came across his best works this would be there. Therefore, I ordered this trilogy.When this book arrived and I saw it I was in thought how long will it take me to finish this! After all it was 1300+ pages. But, being a fierce reader I picked it up and started. As is Haruki style, you pick it up and you can't go back to keep it down.The story is amazing. It cannot be described in words. The characters, each one of them, has their own importance and beauty. The writing style is not that subtle but not at any point can you have the feeling of not understanding the storyline.Post this book I have increased respect for Haruki Murakami as a writer. He picks up his pen to create magic. He is able to create a world where the reader gets lost for good.Thank you Haruki Murakami for writing this book and Amazon for letting readers like me access this wonderful masterpiece.""]";The year is 1Q84.

IT DOES NOT INTENT TO HURT ANYONE’S FEELINGS, AND DOES NOT MEANT TO COMPARE WITH ANY OTHER REVIEWER’S FEELINGS.Well writing a review for this kind of extraordinary book is a big audacity for me. however here I’m, trying to give some brief review of the book.  The book is basically divided into three parts, the first one describes the way the Jews prisoners were treated in the Nazi Concentration Camps and how their lifestyle was. In the second part, the author described the basics of Logotherapy, a way of treatment of the Psychotherapeutic Patients. And finally, in the third part, he described what he actually meant by Man’s Search for meaning.  Being a Jew, the author was transferred to the Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps during the Nazi occupation in Austria. Here, in the first part of the book, the author described his days in those concentration camps, where is were no chance of seeing the morning sun in the next day. And this happened every day. He described the way the SS guards used to treat the prisoners, the corruption prevailed in the camps, the malnutrition, the lifestyle of the camp Jews etc. The way he described the tortures the prisoners suffered, would surely bring tears to your eyes. During his description, he also pointed out the psychological condition of the other comrades in those camps. When most of the prisoners lost all hope of his life, some of them still kept the faith, that good days were coming.  In the second part, the author basically described the Logotherapy Techniques. And the most interesting part of the book is the third part. Here the author describes “Man’s search for meaning”. We, the human beings on this planet are living for a purpose. Until & unless we can’t find the purpose of our life, there is no reason for us to be here alive. Most of the prisoners in the camps lost all of their hopes and then died because they lost their purpose, as per the author. It is a must-read book for all I think.  The book also consists of few life-changing quotes which I liked in the book and would like to share:1. For success, like happiness, can’t be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.2. There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.3. Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great of little. Therefore the ‘size’ of human suffering is absolutely relative.4. No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.5. The human being is completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings.6. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life can’t be completed7. Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.8. There is no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.9. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any ” how”.10. The body has fewer inhibitions than the mind.11. No one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.', 'OMG! It’s a good knowledgeable and yet thrilling book. I have not come across any such book with combination of these two aspects together in one book.So, here is the summary & take away from this thrilling story.The author was a neurologist and psychiatrist. So, by education he knew technical brain anatomy (being neurologist) as well as logical and emotional aspects of human behavior with respect to the brain functioning (being psychiatrist). He spent 3 years in various concentration camps which were basically prisons where Nazis (hitter’s army) used to keep potential threat like prisoner of wars and Jewish during holocaust in 1940 (somewhat during second world war).The book is a journey of the author’s surviving in various camps during his 3 years tenure where he went through immense physical torture, hyper anxiety, inhumane living conditions, insufficient food and unhealthy environment of deadly diseases. The details on tortures were so horrifying that they will give you goosebumps by imagining how humanely it was impossible to bear such pain. The life of prisoner was only a number (a number was printed on everyone’s body) for guards and they looked for every possible opportunity to torture and kill prisoners.At various instances he explained the two aspects of feeling in one scenario where a person is feeling horrified and blessed at the same time. For instance, once few people along with him were standing bare feet in snow for 8 hours straight in one of the camp they were recently transferred and due to frostbite on their foot there was immense pain but at the same time they were happy as standing outside in snow they observed that there was no chimney in the camp (chimney showed that there were gas chambers in camp where prisoners were burned alive). Another instance he talked is that one day they were getting transferred in a train and everyone was anxious that they were getting shifted to a death camp where all of them will be killed yet they happy to see outside scenery after a long time from small holes in train.Author explained that there are various mental stages a person goes through in such camp and at the last stage he becomes numb to death. Imagine that a person is so much scared for a long time that he doesn’t feel scared anymore. His emotional imbalance causes various types of behavioral changes which ultimately makes him inhumane emotionally, after all emotions are something which makes a man different from other living creatures.Now, here to avoid going into the last mental stage where the person gives up the hope to live and dies author explains the ways or tips using which he survived and as well as he help few among himself survive. The first tip is, let me quote exactly what he mentioned in the book is “He who has ‘WHY’ to live, can bear with almost any ‘HOW’. So basically, he explained that if a person has a reason and hope to survive and sees a logical ending to these sufferings will be able to survive. Let me try to explain the reason he has referred here, there were two people in the camp who gave up the hope and wanted to commit suicide author asked few questions to them which made them realize that what reason they must live for. One person had a small kid which would be waiting for him in some other country, so he realized that one day he might have chance to go and live with his kid. Another person had an unfinished script which only he could complete on which he was working from a very long time before he was captured and sent this camp, so he realized that one day he will get freedom and will complete his pending script.Another point to note in above mentioned instance is the reason or hope to live can be anything, it may be a personal matter to you, another human in your life or a thing also. He said “A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears towards other human who affectionately waits for him or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw his life as he knows the WHY for this life & existence and hence will be able to bear with almost any HOW”.He also talked about stimulus and response control which I think was better explained by Steven covey in his book. But one of the quote he put in the book was worth mentioning that “everything can be taken from a man but one thing, and that is one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances”.Lastly, he talked about happiness where he says that “happiness cannot be pursued but ensued”. The happiness is internal, and its means changes time to time, situation to situation, to person to person and like there cannot be a standardize rule to happiness like next movement in a game of chess as movement will be specifically based on current position of other players chess components (hope you understand what I mean). Happiness comes in alignment with your core values in life and which is why it changes time to time, person to person.What I did not like about the book is that there were disconnection in the story he narrated and the journey in camp is not in proper sequence, he only explained some random days and instances which sometime become irritating and disappointing. I understand that the prime purpose of the book was not to take the reader through the day by day, event by event his tenure in camp, but it is to only to use such events of the camp as context to explain the point he is trying to make about human behavior. But I felt that it would have been a very great story of his survival to go through day by day in detail.4 out of 5. So, what’s your meaning of life at this moment in this phase of your life…...? Think about it.', 'In this book writer tells about his story of survival in one of Nazis concentration camps.The very vivid account of events, faith and luck.This book tells us to appreciate everything in our day to day life.All the this that we takes as granted can be so much meaningful in time of their absence.

He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Only those

Most of the books on the list were ones that I had already read, barring one or two, and among those was “The Giver”. I had heard of the book before, but I was recovering from another one of my infamous reading slumps that always seem to happen mid-vacation, and desperate to read anything. So I went and got the Kindle Sample of  the book. I got so immersed that I ended up reading it well into the night.If you follow me on Twitter or Instagram, you would have seen the excited rant that I went into in the middle of the night about the concept of memory explored in the book.The book is set in an indeterminate future where human beings are engineered and brought into this world through Birth Mothers. Every batch of children has about 50 individuals and twins are not allowed. People are given their Assignments at thhe age of 12 and are then coached accordingly.Jonas has grown up in this society, that is believed to be the perfect world.  But at 12, he is given the Assignment of Receiver. He is to be given the memories of the world.What I found reading the book is that the concept of Memory as expressed in this book, is the concept of History. It is the memories of the past. A past before the Sameness, when there existed colour and feelings and emotions.Memories, if understood well, give Wisdom – a quality thought to be essential in Life. And so Jonas gains Wisdom. He starts to see individuality. He starts to see the importance of difference. He sees the importance of emotions and feelings – love, hate, grief, lust. He sees that these make up life and that without these one cannot say that they have truly experienced Life.In essence, I believe, this book tells us the importance of the so-called material things that make Life what it is, and gives the individuality to each life and the differences in between.Human beings search for Happiness. Ironically, in the absence of Grief, Happiness cannot be felt, as it would not be a distinguishable emotion.', 'I liked it. Its a beautiful book with very beautiful and important concept. This is a must read book for children above 6th grade.But you will be little disappointed with characters. While reading the story, I felt no connection between Jonas and his family. May be its due to their community in which they are living and their lack of feelings but there were no emotions. The protagonist, Jonas, is just 12 but he was very matured and working for the greater good(this little thing which might bug you because of his age, it did to me because I was more like Lily, no idea what I was doing but definitely not saving the world). I was disappointed with other characters such as Asher and Fiona because while reading, you will get an impression that they are going to be an important part but sadly, they were cut out of the story. I had already build up some story between Fiona and Jonas in my mind but was disappointed in the end.Now, about the story, beginning of the story felt like Utopia and not the opposite, but later author subtly introduces to the reader that how s***ty their world is and how lucky you can be with not having Sameness. I shudder to think a world without colors and music, same monotonous life without any surprises. It will be a very horrible place.Story carries a very important message but it could have been much better with little bit of more emotions and more connection between characters.Its ending is ambiguous and will keep you hanging in the middle. You have to make peace with your mind by deciding whether its a happy or sad ending.Overall, a great book to read and its worth your time. Hence, definitely recommended.']";It's a perfect world, where everything looks right but ugly truths lie beneath the surface It is the future. There is no war, no hunger, no pain.

No bookmark.', 'Lily Bart, beautiful, impoverished, aged 29, is in urgent need of a rich husband to safeguard her place in the social elite of late-nineteenth-century New York, but somehow she keeps missing her chances. Once I slowed my reading pace to go with its flow, I adored this 1905 classic and, with caveats, highly recommend it. The caveats are: Wharton’s prose style is formal and leisurely – long sentences with many subordinate clauses, abstract ideas and elaborate figures of speech. She explores her characters’ states of mind in great depth, and with a habit of oblique implication rather than clear statement. Additional ambiguity arises from her inability, writing when she did, to refer directly to sex. By the end, all ambiguities are clarified, I wasn’t left guessing, and my inferences had been correct – so the difficulties were ultimately rewarding. One final caveat: there is a Jewish character who is described in the unexamined anti-Semitic clichés of that era. He is, however, one of the few sympathetic characters in a novel in which many others are far more harshly described and judged. The immense power of the book is Lily herself and the love that grows between her and a man who isn’t rich enough to qualify as her husband and who dislikes how she seems to compromise herself. Will they or won’t they? Is she a vapid social butterfly or a person of moral worth and integrity? Wharton kept me willing and hoping, and savouring the journey all the way through.', ""Lily Bart remains unmaried (gasp! shock!) at the ripe old age of twenty-nine; in New York society at the turn of the nineteenth century, her time for making her mark and settling herself in a way of life that she has become accustomed to is fast passing her by.  Lily makes a determined effort to make herself more secure, but in doing so finds her heart perhaps is not so closed as she had imagined it was.  But in opening herself to an emotional vulnerability, she finds herself also getting in deeper than she had ever imagined with men whose idea of a `favour' is not quite what she had in mind.  All Lily ever wanted was to use her beauty to settle herself in a comfortable life; will her attempt to eke out her meager allowance and investments ruin her forever?The novels of Edith Wharton, and Henry James, are wonderful slices of life in America as the nineteenth century turns to the twentieth - the scandals, the scheming, the society way of life - all quite ghastly to us now at our distant remove.  The House of Mirth presents this world to the reader in such a way that the horror of falling on the wrong side of societal expectations is still as fresh as it was when the book was first published in 1905.This is a brilliantly witty and searingly insightful book into the life of a young woman who sees her opportunities, as her youth, passing her by.  In the changing society in which Lily lives, where divorce may be slowly becoming more socially acceptable, her fall to gossip and scandal is all the more painful for her having lived for so long on her wits and beauty.  While the world we live in now is far from perfect, at least women generally have more opportunities than having to `make a good match' or live from independent means in order to be `accepted'.  Totally recommended.""]";The heroine of this Novel is Lily Bart, whose goal is to secure a rich husband who can sustain her lifestyle.

It’s about people and how they change for better.The book follows three different story lines and then at last combines all these three different stories together. This story line of combining three different stories impressed me very much. When the book first starts I was having trouble thinking how could these stories even connectCHARACTERSThe main characters include Micky who is a damaged woman because of what happened in her childhood and ignoring her childhood is the only thing she does. But when Leilani comes to her and begins questioning her about all kinds of stuff, Micky slowly realizes that what happened to her was not her fault. But inside Micky is caring and is worried for Leilani.Leilani is a little girl that starts living in her moto home with her step father and mother. She visits Micky one day and tells her all sorts of things about her weird family. She has a golden soul but is stuck between her neurotic and murderous family.Though Noah Ferrel, the detective, had less scenes but we know that he is a private investigator and too lazy to solve any more cases when Micky comes to him for helping her to find Leilani. Fortunately, at last he thinks about heling her and he does.There are many more characters but they are complex living beings on their own so I’ll just mention them: Aunt Geneva, Micky’s aunt who she lives with; a boy who named himself Curtis (I’ll not tell you why he named himself. No spoilers, remember?); Preston Maddoc, Leilani’s mad professor step-dad; Sinsemilla, Leilani’s almost weird and equally mad mother who’s high half the time in the book.“None of us can ever save himself; we are the instruments of one another’s salvation, and only by the hope that we give to others do we lift ourselves out of the darkness into the light.”WRITING STYLEThe writing style was something that I LOVED. I could recommend this book because of its writing alone. The words used to describe things were so good that this made me read more from this author. This book is filled with witty references to people and movies and it all blends in. Never I thought that the author was using too much words just to describe a moon behind clouds with lines like: “A thieving cloud pocketed the silver moon”“Change isn’t easy, Micky. Changing the way you live means changing how you think. Changing how you think means what you believe about life. That’s hard, sweetie. When we make our own misery, we sometimes cling to it even we want so bad to change, because the misery is something we know The misery is comfortable.”MY REVIEW “It’s also true that sometimes – not often, but once in a great while – your life can change for the better in one moment of grace almost a sort of miracle. Sometimes so powerful can happen, someone so special come along, some precious understanding descend on you so unexpectedly that it just pivots you in a new direction, changes you forever. Girl, I’d give everything I have if that could happen for you.”YOU’LL LIKE IT IF:You’re a fan of great writing style.You like to read a story that is as complex as its characters.YOU’LL NOT LIKE IT IF:If you can’t stand any type of violenceYou don’t like aliens or reading sci-fi for that matter“According to my mother, all the truths of life and all the answers to its mysteries are present to be seenand understood in every incident in our lives, in every place regardless of how grand or humble it may be.”I’d happily give it 5 stars and it will definitely have a place in the top 10 books that I read this year!', 'good condition', ""I have long been a Dean Koontz fan and this book promised to be an interesting read. However there are four separate stories going on in the book, every chapter it switches from one set of characters to another, meaning you end up forgetting 2hat you'd read a few chapters ago.There are about 200 pages in this book that are just filler and not even interesting filler.The overall pacing is plodding and only one story really piqued my interest.Even the ending was a big disappointment, all of the imagined scenarios I made up as I rushed towards the end were better than the actual outcome.I'm really disappointed in this and I only finished the book because I don't like not knowing the ending.For me his best book will always be Watchers and I've yet to read anything from him that gripped me like that book did.""]";Leilani Maddoc's tenth birthday is nine months away. Micky Bellsong is convinced that in nine months and one day, the girl will be dead. And no one seems to care but Micky herself. Micky has a history of making wrong choices and living only for her own desires, but her decision to save the child's life - and pit herself against an adversary as fearsome as he is cunning - takes her on a journey of incredible peril and stunning discoveries, a journey filled with tragedy and joy, with humour, terror and hope, a journey that will change her for

Sherwood Anderson is considered as an earlier master of American literature, and ""Winesburg, Ohio"" is his masterpiece. I\'ve come across his name as well as the book\'s recommendation here and there, but never thought this book would give me so much reading pleasure. The plot construction is sublime, and the narrative flow has left me with a rare fulfilment. This is a collection of short stories but considered as a novel while all the stories put together. Puzzled? Read this book to decide yourself.', ""I first read this book as a Penguin in the 1940's and thoroughly enjoyed it: a tale about early Small Town America. It is a series of tales by a young reporter, looking behind the personalities of the small population. When I searched for a reprint I had remembered the name incorrectly as 'Williamsburg, Ohio' and had librarians in Ohio hunting for a non existent book. Then I remembered the author and the rest was simple: Sherwood Anderson! On Kindle, for a few pence I was able to re-read those magical pages - not at all as I had recalled but even more entrancing.A wonderful book by one of Americas Poets and more than worth the few pence to have it on your Kindle!"", 'Sherwood Anderson\'s ""Winesburg, Ohio"" needs no recommendation from me - since the publication in 1919 of these interlinked short stories, set in a fictional US Mid-West small town, they have been recognised as original & compelling, with a cast of characters sometimes categorised as grotesque but perhaps more generously described as eccentric & seeking fulfilment. Anderson himself never quite achieved the same success with his subsequent novels; but he was hugely influential on other US writers, including Faulkner.One strange feature of this Kindle edition is that it is described as ""illustrated"" - and it is - but not with pictures relating to America in the early 20th century - but with unlabelled reproductions in full colour of 17th/18th ladies from the courts of Kings Louis XIV and/or XV. Perhaps they\'re intended to emphasise the themes of oddity & dislocation in the writing.']";In this moving collection of interrelated stories, Ohio-born Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) illuminates the loneliness and frustration — spiritual, emotional and artistic — of life in a small American town. Winesburg, Ohio subtly portrays as well a young writer's coming of age, searching for love, yearning for a less stifling world.Through the eyes of young George Willard, the inner lives of many of Winesburg's inhabitants open to us. Before George leaves the community, we have learned much about his mother Elizabeth, his friend Helen White, his teacher Kate Swift and other Winesburg residents — the lonely, sensitive Dr. Reefy, the tormented

This was a pity, as there was a lot to enjoy in this skilful story of immigration. And anyone who's not as fanatical about cats as I am might not find the last chapter mattered so much.The Garcia girls - Carla, Sandra (Sandi), Yolanda (YoYo) and Sofia (Fifi) grow up in the Dominican Republic in a wealthy household, but their idyllic childhood comes to an end when their doctor father is threatened by the Trujillo dictatorship and the family is forced to move to New York. In New York, the sisters try to adapt to the American way of life in the Swinging 1960s and politically and socially conscious 1970s, to the suspicion of their very traditional father. The girls end up leading very different lives. All four marry, three get divorced, two (Sandi and Yolanda) have breakdowns. The youngest, Sofia, marries a German, and thus incurs her father's everlasting suspicion. Yolanda becomes a writer and later a university teacher. And, however American they try to be, to a greater or lesser degree all the sisters feel the pull back to their beloved Island, and the life they left there, and their memories will not leave them.Alvarez tells the story in 'reverse order' - the first part deals with the Garcia girls as adults, including Yolanda's return to the Dominican Republic to visit family, Sofia's relationship with her German husband, and Sandi and Yoyo's breakdowns; the second with their teenage and childhood experiences in the US, going further back in time with each chapter; and the final section with their memories of the Dominican Republic, starting with the decision to leave the island and going back through to early memories of Sandi and Yolanda - almost as if Alvarez is making the point that early childhood has proved the prime factor in shaping the girls' lives. The structure is very loose, almost as though the book is a series of linked short stories about the same characters, rather than a novel. There are some beautiful sections. Alvarez is also a poet, and this is apparent in her sumptuous descriptive language, particularly when she describes the Dominican Republic, and childhood memories. There are also some memorable scenes, including Yolanda's return to her native country and visit to elderly relatives, Yolanda's memories of her mother's attempts to become an inventor in their early days in New York, a birthday party the girls throw for their elderly father and Sandi's memories of childhood and of when she saw a sculptor at work in his studio. The narrative flicks between sisters and alights on certain points in their lives, missing a great deal out, and for me this was a major weakness in the book. I felt that the four sisters never quite got defined as individuals (except perhaps Yolanda, who Alvarez went on to write another book about) and that we never learnt quite enough about any of them or how their lives turned out. Carla and Fifi, in particular, were quite thinly defined and Alvarez only focused on them briefly. I also found that the 'reverse order' narrative left the book feeling slightly unfinished - for me, I would have liked a return to the present at the end to tie the story together. However, I did find that Alvarez's depictions of immigrant life in New York, and of four girls trying to adapt to a very different culture to their birth one, were moving and convincing, and I found the information about the Dominican Republic (about which I knew little) fascinating. I also liked the loving relationship (despite Carlos Garcia's conservatism) between the girls and their parents. An interesting read in all, and a quick one - I read it in a day - but I suspect there may be more content, and more detail of character in Alvarez's later novels, two of which are on my 'to read' pile."", ""I have chosen this book because I have already read another one by Julia Alvarez and I have liked it very much. I can say I wasn't disapppointed: You can't stop reading it, It is really entretaining. It is not exactly a novel but stories whose characters era always the four García girls;  they can be read independently if you wish. Another good point of the book is that the story begins with what is happening at present and then move backwards up to the moment when the girls are small and live in Dominican Republic. You will enjoy this book."", 'I was assigned this book for uni work. Most book I’ve been assigned - I love, even if they aren’t my usual genre. However, this was a major thumbs down.']";In the 1960s, political tension forces the Garcâia family away from Santo Domingo and towards the Bronx. The sisters all hit their strides in America, adapting and thriving despite cultural differences, language barriers, and prejudice. But Mami and Papiare more traditional, and they have far more difficulty adjusting to their new country. Making matters worse, the girls--frequently embarrassed by their parents--find ways to rebel against them.  Read more

However, after I read it years ago I ""tape flagged"" it to death!  (I sometimes use those little flags to mark spots I need to re-read to better commit to memory.)  I\'d been viciously attacked by a dog & was off work 15 months to have my face reconstructed.  Not being the kind of person who ever sought therapy or shrinks I sought books to help me cope.  At that time ""codependant"" was the culture\'s big buzz word.  You could find 100 books on codependency in the books stores, but few books that fit my need.  Then I landed on Robert Veninga\'s ""A Gift of Hope"".  The book helped me to heal, and I could see that it was applicable to people not just with physical injuries, but mental and spiritual as well; and those going through divorces or other tough times.  I got a book discount buying card at the local bookstores & ordered about a dozen of these books at a time (I have no doubt in total I probably bought at least 4 dozen of these)!  I kept a couple in my car most of the time.  I gave these books away to many I met in their times of need.  (I was somewhat bandaged up for some time after the attack & surgeries so I oftentimes drew curious people... many of whom had their own problems).  I tried to assist others who\'d been attacked by dogs, or facially disfigured; some who I met by chance, others who were eventually referred to me by groups I joined on the internet, or by friends, etc.  This book was a staple for me to leave the walking-wounded with.  I recently ran across my copy with it\'s colorful tape flags outside the margin and it took me back.  I also realized I no longer had an extra copy of it on-hand so I bought another - just in case.  Mr. Veninga is a kind man, who didn\'t write ""over my head"", but who salved my traumatized self.', 'I bought the first edition of this book in 1984, when our five-year-old daughter was going through a bone marrow transplant and slowly dying. I needed some comfort. I often read it in secret, not wanting to dash the hopes of my husband but needing shoring up for myself. I lived in the U of MN with her for two months, and even though they did everything that they could, my gut told me what would eventually happen.This book taught me that there is more than one way to grieve, which was a great help when she died and I found that my husband grieved one way and I another. The difference was that I had been anticipating her death for nearly two years, but my husband did not truly believe that it would ever happen. As a consequence, when she did pass, my grieving was essentially over but his was just beginning. The book helped me to see that this was perfectly normal and it helped me to be supportive of him while being sensitive to him being, I am sure, slightly baffled by my different style of grief. It also helped me focus on both our three-year-old daughter, and the unborn child who would be born seven months later and be diagnosed with the same cancer three months after that. I also learned that I should not feel guilty for the relief which I felt upon her death, for I was finally able to look forward rather than be stuck in the horrible present.This is an easy read, not heavy with jargon, but rich with examples of hope. It is, in short, ""A Gift of Hope"".', 'The author goes in to detail explaining the stages people go through when tragedies occur.  He explains very well not all people handle the life changing occurrence by what others say and do.  It often takes months and years for some to come to terms with a tragedy.

The characters were numerous - so much so that I kept forgetting who was who and what they'd done and had to keep flipping back to where they first entered the story. This got a bit too muchs so that in the end I gave up looking and just read on hoping that who they were would be made plain. Big Ger, Sioban and the Inspector were well kent but not the others.  Still, it was a good book and I'm glad I bought it."", 'Resurrection Men is the thirteenth in the Rebus series written by Ian Rankin and in my opinion it is one of the best.Right from the start Rankin establishes that this book is very much a fifty-fifty split between our hero and his understudy Siobhan Clark. No longer working on the same cases but from different angles like in previous books, the two are now not even in the same police station for the majority of this book.Rebus is back in training as his temper has finally got the better of him. Whilst looking into the murder of a local art dealer, Rebus’s frustration reaches boiling point and he throws a cup of tea at his commanding officer. Finally having gone too far he is banished to the Scottish Police College for retraining leaving Siobhan and the team to attempt to solve the murder without him.I found this book to be a very, very good read. All the usual elements of an Ian Rankin book are present. The story as usual is intricate and moved along at a very fast pace and at times I found myself just as confused as Rebus as to who the good guys and who the bad guys were.All in all I found this to be a very satisfying read and very enjoyable. I would highly recommend this to any fan of the crime genre and to Rebus fans in particular.', 'But this seems less likeable than others in the series. Perhaps as I read them out if order.

Brother Cadfael watches the procession as the both bride and groom ride into the town with the bride and her entourage staying at the abbey.  He thinks the bride is not too keen on the marriage and wonders whether there is more behind it than meets the eye.  A leper is struck out of the way of the procession by the bridegroom though in the main the town is tolerant of the lepers at St Giles hospital.When the bridegroom is found murdered a young squire of his is under suspicion but Cadfael doesn't believe him guilty and sets out to find out the real murderer.  This is an entertaining mystery with some interesting sub plots and some well drawn characters and situations.  I like the historical background and can almost feel as though I am in twelfth century Shrewsbury while I am reading. This book has interesting information about the treatment of leprosy at that date.If you enjoy historical crime stories then this series is a good one to try.  The books can be read in any order though some of the characters do reappear in other books."", 'I really love the Brother Cadfael novels, but for some reason this was slightly disappointing. I\'m sad about that because it was one of the last two I hadn\'t read; only The Pilgrim of Hate left now and I have read them all...sigh. I\'m not sure why but the characters were not quite as engaging as usual, probably entirely my fault because it is an earlier book in the series, the characters are a little less well-rounded, and I really missed the interactions between Cadfael and Hugh, who doesn\'t appear in this story. Cadfael\'s relationship with his Abbot is still a trifle shaky, which adds to the feeling of something missing for me, as Radulphus comes over as a rather cold and spiky character, not at all as he appears in the later novels. As I say, my fault for not reading them all in order, which I\'d highly recommend if you are just beginning on the saga - start at the beginning and I\'d be surprised if you don\'t find yourself wanting to read them all. Brother Cadfael is a wonderfully wise, canny, down-to-earth and humorous character and certainly grows in stature towards the end. As ever the backgrounds of the Abbey, the leper sanctuary and the town are beautifully portrayed and there is, as ever, a romance as well as a murder to be solved. I think it may well be a book which will engage me more second time around. If you don\'t want to start at the beginning of the saga - which I honestly believe you should - then read ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" which in my humble opinion is the best thing Ellis Peters ever wrote. Sheer genius, and Brother Cadfael at his devious best!', 'The fifth Cadfael instalment returns to standard chapters from the previous number. The contest between Stephen and Matilda is now more distant, and ‘The Leper of St Giles’ stays within the immediate neighbourhood of the abbey and concerns itself with a local high-profile wedding. (St Giles is the leper’s chapel just up the road to the east and would be the first prominent building to be seen as the traveller approached Shrewsbury from that direction.)Young love features highly again in the story, and I’m starting to get a little annoyed by its central prevalence in so many of the series. Peters also has a tendency too, like Dickens, to place people in boxes marked ‘good’ and ‘bad’, when we all know that every one of us is a mixture of both.But on the plus side, Peters continues with her detailed descriptions of life and mores of the time, although I am not sure that Amice of Thornbury could be so precise about her timings in an age largely devoid of clocks, especially in rural areas.I was going to write how Peters in ‘The Leper of St Giles’ comes up with one of her usual ingenious plots. But there is more in this volume, for at the book’s end, just when you think all seems settled and obvious, the last chapter manages to produce one last plot twist that goes on to disprove my theory about the black-and-white moral characterisation of the people her imagination creates.How can I not praise, therefore, a writer who not only dumbfounds me with the plot but also confounds my presumptions about her characters?']";Busy on an errand Cadfael has no time to think about the grand wedding which is to take place in the abbey church. The groom is an ageing nobleman, the bride a young woman who has been coerced into marriage. It does not look set to be a happy one, but before it takes place a killing occurs and Cadfael determines to find out the truth.  Read more

It\'s why I love books like POISON STUDY, THE THIEF, and THE MIDNIGHT LIE. There\'s just something so richly rewarding about seeing someone being granted a second chance, even if that second chance comes with major strings attached. When I read a book, I like having someone to root for.Sudian, our hero, is such an amazingly complex hero. I\'ve never read about a fantasy character quite like him. He\'s a notorious rogue, assassin, thief, and knave, feared throughout all the kingdoms, with as many faces as a octahedral die. When he\'s brought to the king of Alyndar, he basically assumes that it\'s his neck on the block-- and it is, only not in any usual assassination. Instead, the king\'s chancellor (who is also a magician) binds Sudian to a magical Oath. He can\'t take on any of his nefarious past activities, cannot harm any member of the royal family of Alyndar or its councilors, and he must act as squire to the king\'s youngest son, Prince Edward, and succeed where all his past scholars and squires failed: see that he graduates from the school of hard knocks and gets landed.Landing, in this book, means getting land. Because a noble just isn\'t a noble if they don\'t have something to lord over. And Edward is way more frustrating than any noble that Sudian has encountered. Not because he\'s a terrible person-- but because he wants very much to be a good person. He wants to singlehandedly take up the cause of every disenfranchised person in the empire, whether it\'s slavery in one of the outer countries, or giving money to beggars in the streets, but his privilege and upbringing blinds him to the changes he could easily make in his own bearing and behavior, and Sudian is exasperated and annoyed by turns when Edward thinks nothing of sending him back out in the rain for many miles to retrieve a lost shovel, or casually gives him orders with the expectation that they\'ll be followed because that\'s simply what\'s done.Ned truly does have a kind heart though, and this ends up almost feeling like one of those buddy movies, as Sudian begins to see how Ned could be an amazing man-slash-ruler in his own right once he literally gets off his high horse and starts paying attention to people on their own terms and not just as causes that he can take up to glory in his own perceived virtue.Sudian is also a really fascinating character. First, major props to the author for her portrayal of someone who was warped by psychological abuse. Sudian\'s mannerisms and way of thinking are totally shaped by what his mother did to him as a child, and it\'s heartbreaking-- especially once he finally begins to feel safe enough to trust others and let a select few in. He\'s also incredibly clever and I liked that he was short and wasn\'t described as being particularly attractive (even though I think the guy on the cover of this book is quite attractive); everyone who likes him likes him for his compelling personality and unique set of skills. unlike 99% of alleged kick-butt heroes and heroines, Sudian can walk the walk as well as he can talk the talk.And the action scenes! The adventure scenes! The witty dialogue! The TENSION!I\'m honestly shocked that more people aren\'t clamoring over this book, to be honest. It reminds me of books I\'ve read by Janny Wurts and Mercedes Lackey, set in worlds where bad things sometimes happen, but they aren\'t grim-dark, and all of the characters (including the women characters) are fleshed-out and interesting in their own way, and the adventure of the journey is as good as the destination. I loved the ending of this book and can\'t wait to read the sequel (which I\'ve already bought). You can get both for $2.99 on Kindle as of my posting, so what are you even waiting for?5 out of 5 stars', ""This book was completely captivating and well written. I think this story shows how rumors and legends can overtake reality... Nightfall isn't quite the big, bad demon that legend makes him out to be; he's got weaknesses and strengths like anyone else. This made his character (and the story) very believable.Prince Edward's incredible naivete was humorous, but as the story progresses, he begins to learn more and to grow up. At times in the beginning of the book, I wanted to throttle him because of that innocence, but as the story progressed, his character began to mature.One thing that was completely unique was Nightfall's magical ability to change his weight, thus greatly contributing to his success as a thief. I don't recall ever seeing this ability used in any other book I've read, and I loved the uniqueness of it. His ability allows him to become heavier (to stand firm or balance) and become lighter (to lessen the impact of a fall or climb more easily).I was completely involved in this book and could not put it down (even though that meant staying up past four in the morning to finish it!)

No, these women enjoy and understand nature, they studied biology, science has meaning for them, they live by their wits and they love men but they aren't dollies or money grabbing high-flyers. This book is  a breath of fresh air."", ""This novel captured all my heart. The book alternates between three stories whose links gradually emerge, set in a tiny community of 600 people where, every person is somehow linked to the few inhabitants of the area as well as intimately linked to the nature that surrounds them.First there is Deanna Wolfe, a 47-year-old biologist who lives in a log cabin payed to scour the National Forest land for poachers while keeping track of her beloved coyotes that settle nearby. The divorcee's two-year solitude is interrupted by Eddie Bondo, a sheep farmer 20 years her junior, who reconnects her with her physical needs for proximity and social companionship.Secondly there is Lusa Landowski, a city-born entomologist married to Cole Widener whose family makes it very hard for her to settle. The day personal tragedy strikes, she gradually finds a way to love the area, to find her own calling and grows closer to her five sisters-in-law and their children.Thirdly, there is the elderly Garnett Walker whose main purpose in life is to revive the American chestnut tree, made extinct by loggers and fungal blight, while warring with his neighbour, Nannie Rawley. Here again, the story evolves beautifully and the two neighbours grow to accept and help each other in ways they could not anticipate initially.The three main women protagonists have in common their fierce independence and strength of personality and the novel insists convincingly on the shared animality of humans, regardless of their efforts to subdue nature. The descriptions of the passing seasons, the fecundity of the earth and beauty of the surrounding woodlands is rendered so well that I was captured by every single page of this book.Highly recommended!"", 'I’ve become a huge fan of the author since reading a few of her books last year so am working my way through her back catalogue. I enjoyed Prodigal Summer though not as much as her other books. Love stories runs through the book and to be honest I didn’t enjoy these moments as much as the rest of the book. I could have done without the sex scenes between Deanna and her hunter. I’m not a prude but sex scenes in books irritate me more than not. I just want them to stop so I can get on with the rest of the story. I really enjoyed the way the lives of Deanna, Lusa and the feuding neighbours gradually interweave and you gradually find out the links between them with some connections bigger and more obvious than others. The characters are well written and really come to life. I also loved the sense of places created in the book and as ever the author’s beautiful prose.']";It is summer in the Appalachian mountains and love, desire and attraction are in the air.

To not finish a book is something I rarely do, and it pains me to admit to having given up.A SHORT HISTORY OF A SMALL PLACE by T.R. Pearson is a narrative by Louis Benfield about his parents (“Momma” and “Daddy”)  and the fictional town of Neely and its residents. Near as I can determine from the portion of the book I read, the author located Neely in North Carolina. The time frame is the twentieth century from the 30’s to the 70’s and much of what is told is based on Daddy’s memories from the time before Louis was born.The story that Louis tells could only take place in the South if we agree that life is slower below the Mason-Dixon line. The narrative itself reflects the languorous pace of the tale as one might hear it told on a porch on a sultry evening while drinking lemonade; it wanders and sidebars and detours away from and back to the main character of the moment, e.g. the spinster Miss Pettigrew and her pet monkey, in ways that are either captivating or maddening.A SHORT HISTORY OF A SMALL PLACE, at 381 paperback pages, promises to be a long read as the print size is relatively small and the paragraphs are lengthy; some go on for a full page or more.Some will find the book positively charming and award five stars.

I am sure you too will love to read this book if you have not read it already.Book Overview – “Good to Great” by Jim Collins-This book describes the characteristics of many companies who leaped from being a good company to a great company. However, many companies fail to make the evolution from good to great. Jim Collins along with a team of 21 researchers researched the financial analysis of many companies. They came with the list of companies whose growth and achievement far outperformed the market or industry average, and eventually achieved corporate greatness. To know the list of companies, do check out the book.The author suggests readers consider the transformation of good to great as a process of build-up followed by breakthrough. There are mainly 3 stages to determine a company’s ability to achieve greatness:1-  Disciplined People2-  Disciplined Thought3-  Disciplined ActionAdditionally, within each of the 3 stages Author defines explicit characteristics of companies that went from good to great:-  Level 5 LeadershipThese leaders channelize their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company. This doesn’t mean that Level 5 leaders don’t have ego or self-interest. Certainly, they are extremely ambitious—however, their ambition is first and primary for the organization, not themselves-  First Who, Then WhatFirst, you need to get the right people in your company (Leadership Team) and figure out the best path to greatness. You don't need to find “what to do?” in hurry. First, build a team of people with the right skill and mindset, then decide what this great team will do for the company (what to do?).-  Confront the Brutal FactsContinuously hone your path to greatness based on the brutal facts. Face the reality, good or bad, and act accordingly.-  Hedgehog ConceptThis concept originated from the story of Fox and Hedgehog, where the hedgehog sees what is most essential and discount what is non-essential. Hedgehog Concept is made up of 3 intersecting circlesCircle 1- What you are deeply passionate about?Circle 2- What you can be the best in the world at?Circle 3- What drives your economic engine?-  Culture of DisciplineThis is not just about action; it is about getting disciplined people who engage in disciplined thought and then take disciplined action.-  Technology AcceleratorsPioneering sensibly certain technology as an accelerator of momentum.-  The Flywheel and the Doom Loop As you determinedly push the flywheel and build thrust you will ultimately hit a point of breakthrough. On other hand, the doom loop is a lack of gathering momentum where a company skips build-up and goes straight to breakthrough, which in turn, fails to uphold a steady direction.Based on the studies and research Collins concludes that there is substantial evidence that early leaders followed the good-to-great framework. Notable point is that they did so as entrepreneurs in early-stage enterprises. Even though the companies analyzed in Good to Great was enterprise companies; the author saw the same characteristics in small, early-stage enterprises.My 2 Cents…This book was released in 2001, as of today some of the great companies featured in this book are no longer great. However, the author and his research team viewed and analyzed these companies as looking into the past, hence didn’t claim future success of these companies. They put across the data spanning 15 years span where they were great, and the characteristics that lead them to that point.The author has not claimed that companies mentioned in the book as great will always remain great.I found this book very well researched, and Jim Collins and his team have done a great work presenting such vast data and case studies in a categoric format. Their methodology does have some flaws but it's best to focus on the positives as this book does provide great insights on the characteristics of good to great companies."", 'Excellent content with facts and stories', '']";________________________________ Can a good company become a great one? If so, how? After a five-year research project, Jim Collins concludes that good to great can and does happen. In this book, he uncovers the underlying variables that enable any type of organisation to make the leap from good to great while other organisations remain only good. Rigorously supported by evidence, his findings are surprising - at times even shocking - to the modern mind. Good to Great achieves a rare distinction: a management book full of vital ideas that reads as well as a fast-paced novel. It is widely regarded

The characters are not as interesting as the ones in The Scar, but the city and its intrigues are described with such vividity and detail that the boring bits of the story are carried along in the strong undercurrent.This is one of those books that you will inhale in a day or two if it is up your alley.', ""This book is long. Really long. Like nearly a 1000 pages long. It is fantasy after all.But it's not fantasy as you know it. Mieville, as always, bucks the trend and sticks every middle finger and tentacle up at fantasy stereotypes. You won't find elves here, instead finding humanoid insects and living, breathing cacti.Mieville's worldbuilding and prose are dense and at times difficult, but I did not once find myself tempted to stop. There's a distinct danger of attempting to read the book cover to cover, something I'm not sure is even possible with such a hefty tome (if you need an extra little bit of justification to buy the paper copy, it would make a handy door stop or paperweight or blunt-force weapon should you be burgled).It's hard to decide which bit I liked most: the depth and connection with the characters (a difficult feat in fantastic literature, especially when key characters include a mysterious giant bird man (who lost his wings, of course) and an anthropomorphised insectoid artist.), the quality of the prose or the gripping plot. Yes, it's not perfect, every book has its flaws. This is certainly a more literary and weird version of the fantastic than many readers will be used to. But the rewards are worth it.You should go into this with the full knowledge that you will soon be purchasing the sequels, and lamenting the fact that only three exist in the series. At a push, I'd say The Scar manages to trump Perdido, which you may find hard to believe when reading it. You'll then go on to buy Mieville's entire catalogue. It's a good thing the paper copies are so well designed; I have one very well decorated shelf in my book case. After completing Bas Lag, I'd recommend (well, anything) Embassytown or The City & The City, which the BBC just released a four-part series of. That Perdido Street Station has not had the GoT treatment yet is criminal.Halfway through reading the book I had already purchased both sequels, and given copies to three friends.

Though there were 50, I narrowed it down to 6. Angela’s Ashes is one of them. I’m glad I picked it. Also, I didn’t know that it has won the Pulitzer Prize, so there was an extra layer of welcome to read the book.The book is kind of slow to start with even though the narrative is fast. It starts with a brief history of the family. After that it is poverty all the way through and how he and his family scrape through. Despite the never-ending poverty, what makes it readable in the richness in writing. The book is very engaging and only half way through the book, I decided that I need to read his sequel, “’Tis”. Also, the sequel’s sequel “The Teacher Man”. The only other time I ever wanted a sequel was to “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” movie.At a chapter, when he is 13 going on 14 and he and his family is living in another person’s house, there are some really humiliating and embarrassing scenes which I bet will leave you teary eyed. But also, the writer doesn’t write it seriously. It’s not used as a crescendo moment. It’s the first time where I really discovered the Tragicomic aspect in a book. Its magical to say the least. You feel sad but at the same time appreciate the writing, which kind of makes you even.I like the way the book ended. The chapters in the book simply start with Roman numerals and doesn’t contain any heading. The last chapter of the book is simply “’Tis” which is the sequel. It’s a nice bit of touch. The only other time I ever appreciated the naming of the chapters in a book is “Open”, the first chapter is “The End” and the last chapter is “The Beginning”. Strange, but you will understand when you read that book.The best thing about a memoir is that you become emotionally invested in the lead character. There is so much of emotions to relate and it can really be a trip down the memory lane, no matter how weak your memory is. Also, reading about the hard times, you will get to appreciate your life even more.', ""Every once in a while, a lucky reader comes across a book that makes an unforgettable impression, a book you immediately want to share with everyone around you, Angela's Ashes is that book.“You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.”-Frank McCourt, Angela's Ashes"", 'One will enjoy the course of the book.

Entsprechend groß und leicht zu enttäuschen waren die damaligen Erwartungen des Publikums an dieses Werk. Die anschließende Kritik umfasste dann auch das gesamte Spektrum der möglichen Meinungen.Nähert man sich mit dem gehörigen zeitlichen Abstand der Erzählung, so stellt man fest, dass die Idee zu dem Buch vielversprechend ist. Eco verlegt die Handlung in die erste Hälfte des 17.  Jahrhunderts. Eine Zeit, in der die Seefahrt noch dadurch erschwert wurde, dass zwar die Breitengrade durch Vertikalmessung vor allem des Polarsterns ohne weiteres bestimmt werden konnten, die Bestimmung der Längengrade indes mangels hinreichend genauer Zeitmessung ein Problem darstellte.Um dieses Problem lösen zu können, wird Roberto de la Grive, der Protagonist der Erzählung, von dem französischen Staatsmann Colbert ausgeschickt, die vermeintlich besser informierten Engländer auf einer Seereise in die Südsee zu bespitzeln. Ein Sturm auf hoher See lässt das Schiff jedoch sinken und der Nichtschwimmer de la Grive kann sich als Einziger der Besatzung mit Hilfe eines Bretts auf die zuvor vor einer Insel vor Anker gegangene aber scheinbar verwaiste 'Daphne' retten.Die Insel ist so nah, für einen Nichtschwimmer aber wiederum unerreichbar. Zudem soll zwischen dem Schiff und der Insel der 180. Längengrad verlaufen, mithin die Datumsgrenze. Neben dem sich entspinnenden Überlebenskampf stellt sich für de la Grive die philosophische Frage, ob auf der über der Datumsgrenze - also im gestern - liegenden Insel in die Vergangenheit eingegriffen und damit kurz zurückliegende Ereignisse ungeschehen gemacht werden können.Die Verbindung des Topos 'einsame Insel' mit dem Moment der Zeitreise hört sich nicht nur verheißungsvoll an, sondern ist auch atmosphärisch dicht erzählt und lädt zum Nachdenken ein. Immerhin hat die Philosophie über die Jahrhunderte gerätselt, ob die Zeit eine reine Anschauungsform des menschlichen Geistes (Leibniz, Kant) oder eine davon unabhängige reale Größe ist (Newton).Leider stehen dem Erzählfluss der Insel des vorigen Tages die etwas zu zahlreichen Rückblicke in das vergangene Leben des Roberto de la Grive einem makellosen Leseerlebnis entgegen. Deswegen vier Sterne."", 'Ein Schiffbrüchiger wird irgendwo in der Südsee gegen ein vermeintlich verlassenes Schiff gespült und kann so sein Leben retten. Kaum an Bord bemerkt er, dass das nächste Land in Sichtweite ist und es auf dem Schiff viel Eigenartiges zu entdecken gibt. Doch Roberto de La Grive, so der Name des jungen Schiffbrüchigen, hat ein Problem: er kann nicht schwimmen. So hat er alle Zeit der Welt, auf sein Leben zurückzublicken, das im Piemont begann, ihn durch einen richtigen Krieg und die Pariser Salons bis auf eine Mission führte, welche die Welt verändern soll. Denn Roberto soll nichts Geringeres lüften als das Geheimnis, wie man auf See den Längengrad und damit die exakte Position ermittelt. Ein Kunststück, das Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts niemand beherrscht.Damit ist über die Geschichte des Buches im Grund noch nicht viel gesagt. Denn schließlich haben wir es mit einem Roman von Eco zu tun, da ist ein üppiges geistesgeschichtliches Sittengemälde ja wohl das Allermindeste!Auf die Gefahr hin, hier zu viel zu verraten [SPOILER], gehe ich nochmal ins Detail:Roberto ist zunächst in diversen Selbstreflektionen gefangen, z.B. biographischen. Einige Kapitel aus seiner Vergangenheit werden im Wechsel mit Passagen auf dem Schiff erzählt, und immer lernte Roberto darin etwas fürs Leben und immer steht diese konkrete Erfahrung für seine Zeit. Er trifft sarkastische Agnostiker und naturforschende Geistliche,  er trifft die sich in Philosophie und philosophischen Spekulationen übenden Damen und Dandys von Paris ebenso wie wild salbadernde Frühformen von Naturwissenschaftlern, die de facto eher Magie und Mystizismus betrieben, er begegnet machtbewußten Kirchenfürsten und, und, und. Es rollen sich weite Teile der Geisteswelt dieser Zeit vor dem Leser ab, doch nicht genug damit.Als de La Grive endlich einen Gesprächspartner findet, erreichen die Diskussionen zum Ursprung von Himmel und Erde sowie der Astronomie ein neues Niveau. Neben der gewiss faszinierenden Frage nach den Längengraden kommt z.B. zur Sprache, wo Gott das Wasser für die Sintflut her nahm und wo die Sonne am Tag ihrer Erschaffung von Gott hingesetzt wurde. Das hat schon was: Gott erschuf die Sonne und setzte sie an den Himmel, aber wo stand sie zuerst in Bezug zur Erde? War es Mitternacht im Garten Eden? Mittag in Jerusalem? Das mag sich lustig anhören, doch in dieser Zeit wurde oft genug naturwissenschaftlich diskutiert, ohne dabei die Informationen aus der Bibel in Frage zu stellen.Anders verhält es sich bei der Frage nach den Längengraden, einem ganz realen Problem. Ob ich mich auf der Süd- oder Nordhalbkugel befinde, sagen mir die Sterne, und auch der Sonnenstand zu einem bestimmten Tag, zu einer bestimmten Jahreszeit ist ein wichtiger Hinweis. Aber der Längengrad der eigenen Position lässt sich nur mit einem Referenzort und einer Referenzzeit bestimmen...doch das führt hier gewiss zu weit.Ferner beschäftigt sich Roberto manisch mit einer in mehrfacher Hinsicht unerreichbaren geliebten Dame, deren Geschichte sich zu allem Überfluss mit der seines phantomhaften Bruder Ferrante vermengt. Schlussendlich gibt der allwissende Erzähler auch noch seinen Senf dazu und kommentiert im Grunde seine eigene Erzählung.Man könnte noch diverse Themen ausmachen, ich allerdings halte hier ein. ""Die Insel des vorigen Tages"" ist, wie nicht anders zu erwarten, ein komplexes Manöver, und leider nicht immer lohnend. Die astronomischen Debatten an Bord eines ganz romantisch anmutenden Schiffchens in einer Südseebucht, das hatte was. Das schreckliche Gequatsche über pseudo-wissenschaftliche Wundermittelchen gewiss nicht. Auch bin ich nicht sicher, ob die seitenlangen Ausführungen über die zahllosen widersprüchlichen symbolischen Bedeutungen der Taube (lüstern, treu, friedlich usw.) oder seitenlange lateinische Aufzählungen mich weitergebracht haben.Letztlich hat der Roman hochinteressante Passagen, ist mir aber zu zerfasert und hat mich im Grunde zu keiner Zeit wirklich gepackt. Mehr Konzentration auf das Wesentliche inklusive der Hauptfiguren hätte gut getan. Es bleibt der Eindruck, dass alles konstruiert wurde, um noch irgendeine obskure Facette von Gott-weiß-welchem Wissensgebiet auszubreiten.

From a Jewish boyhood in pre-revolutionary Russia, Paltiel traveled down a road that embraced Communism, only to return to Russia and discover a Communist Party that had become his mortal enemy.

This is a well written and thought provoking book that I read in one sitting. It is interesting for the general reader but it is essential reading for mental health professionals and (especially) researchers. It is sometimes construed that debates about mental health are polarised between the psychiatric establishment (ie people like me) and critics of psychiatry, but Rosenhan’s study is a key work that I was taught about as a medical student in the 1970s. I have recommended it countless students over 40 years. With rigour, doggedness and great integrity, Cahalan has demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that Rosenhan committed research fraud. What all of the reviewers have missed is the much more shocking and important revelation that Robert Spitzer (also a professor of psychiatry) knew about this shortly after the paper was published. Spitzer was the architect of DSM III and unwittingly led US psychiatry to eventually creat the monster that is DSM V. It suited Spitzer to keep quiet about a fraudulent paper in Science, because it strengthened his case for radical change in diagnostic practice. Highly recommended.', 'David Rosenhan was a psychologist at Stanford University. In 1970 he led an experiment in which eight normal people faked symptoms to secure admission to psychiatric hospital. He concluded that psychiatry could not distinguish sanity and insanity. The results were published in the elite journal Science, then picked up by the media. It was embraced by critics of the mental health system. It is referenced in textbooks today.But was it really what it claimed?Susannah Cahalan has produced an investigation that I can only describe as riveting. She tracked down everyone who knew Rosenhan, everything he wrote. She spoke to family, friends and colleagues. In particular she set her sights on the eight subjects, anonymous in the paper. Were they still alive? Could she locate them? Could she ask for their memory of their experience?The author claimed an interest for her curiosity. She had herself been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and has written about this. She is not a psychiatrist but is respected in the medical community, frequently lecturing to professional audiences.She addresses the wider questions raised by Rosenhan’s paper. Can we really not tell sanity from insanity?  Is there a such a thing as mental illness? Her answer to the second is unequivocal – mental illness is a reality. Closing down hospitals did not solve the problem. Psychiatry has generally failed to offer a solution at least not in the way we manage cancer or heart failure. It has had some success though and we must continue to hope for advances. Her optimism somewhat tempered she concludes the book with “I believe”.It is a great book with a couple of caveats. She puts a lot of her own experience into the account, which we could understand. Her style of writing is a bit free at times – “throw a rock into a crowd in the 1800s and there’s a good chance you’d hit someone who’d spent time in an asylum”.Set against this is the reach of her investigation – determined and detailed. Her background in news helped her to get people to talk about things both personal and painful. How upfront has she been though? It becomes clear that among leading psychiatrists Rosenhan did not command respect. There were doubts about his research, serious questions were raised. By and large these were not publicised. By 2015 most of those who led the field in 1970 had either died [Rosenhan deceased in 2012] or long retired. Was now the time? Did someone drop a hint to the author?', 'This is an excellent book written . The writing is accessible and intelligent and deeply compassionate.The author’s experiences of  mental ill health add weight to her investigation and her concerns  as she wrestles with the stories she uncovers.It is a fascinating and thorough investigation and it has certainly made me reevaluate mental distress and the ways we treat those who are suffering.'];For centuries, doctors have struggled to define mental illness - how do you diagnose it, how do you treat it, how do you even know what it is? In search of an answer, in the 1970s a Stanford psychologist named David Rosenhan and seven other people - sane, normal, well-adjusted members of society - went undercover into asylums around America to test the legitimacy of psychiatry's labels. Forced to remain inside until they'd 'proven' themselves sane, all eight emerged with alarming diagnoses and even more troubling stories of their treatment. Rosenhan's watershed study broke open the field of psychiatry, closing

Puh-nin? Pin?) of the grand Russian origin, with his Pninian antics, joins an insignificant college in America, and struggles to keep up with peculiar ways of the society. Nabokov is a genius of words, a musician of language, and in his craft, creates a language of his own to describe the misadventures of the ill-fated, our poor protagonist, an object of pity, the sweet and doomed, Pnin.What is essentially a campus novel, transforms into a personal tale of trampled hopes and desire to live on. In what is one of the (if not 'the') most hilarious opening chapters, we are introduced to our protagonist while he is on a train journey. A misfortune is identified immediately, and through a chain of struggles, pity, and failures, the novel ends with yet another misfortune. Nabokov makes the reader laugh through his wizardry of letters, while also telling a deeply moving tale of a brilliant scholar who has not failed but is failed by the world around him - by his wife, his colleagues, his friends, his employer. But with the energy and jive of a certain Mr Tambourine Man, he continues to build castles of hope from the bricks of his sufferances.In the end, the author made me feel disgusted for laughing at Pnin, for he was not the one to be laughed at but to be held in the arms, which the reader might have chosen to pierce into the pages, and subsequently get sucked only to be able to walk beside him as he lived on. This was my first work of Nabokov (I haven't read Lolita yet. Nada.) and while it was not an easy read, it was an intellectually satisfying one, opening me up for a completely unexplored area of English literature - that of the great Nabokovian tragedy."", ""Decided to have another go at understanding the appeal of Nabokov, as I failed appreciating the masterpiece that is 'Lolita'. It may be a question of writing at the different time (however Moliere is still funny today), but very little of his writing is, as quoted by one reviewer, 'hilarious'.

Pretty narrative. The subtleties of this book are underrated. It's brilliant thought process and the writer has come very close to that concept"", 'After a long time, I read a fiction that gripped me till the end. Kazuo Ishiguro’sNever Let Me Go performed that bewitching magical spell on me. Written in anaturally simple style and language, the novel did not force me even once torefer to a dictionary–the language that simple from a Nobel laureate speaks ofa rare achievement.What holds us in a thrall in the novel? Ishiguro has employed the technique ofgradual disclosures of the fate and condition of the novel’s young characters.Words like ‘carer’, ‘donor’ and ‘completing’ make us curious about the youngcharacters who appear normal, yet strange. Where are their parents? Why doartworks play a significant role in their lives? Why can’t they live a normal life ofaspirations?  Why do some people keep a distance from them? The search ofanswers to these questions compel us to turning the pages.For long, the novel seems to be nothing but a typical novel that charminglyreminisces the school days of girlhood/boyhood and the sexual awakening ofadolescence. Once we learn that the apparently normal boys and girls are clonedcreatures meant to be ‘harvested’ for the health and longevity of the mainstreampopulace, our hearts begin to give away layer after layer, sinking us in a mucky,choking sadness.Even as the characters–Kathy, Tommy and Ruth–know their fates, they fall in loveand hope for an extension of life. But neither love nor art can redeem them fromthe inevitable fate that the supremely sophisticated medical science has inventedfor them. Ruth completes her role and so does Tommy; Kathy lives on to tell us thetale without anger or frustration. She longs for Tommy’s love, but does not utterwords of complain about those who made them like that. The last paragraph of thenovel reveals the absurdity of the days gone and of vagueness of the days yet tobe lived:”I was thinking about the rubbish, the flapping plastic in the branches, the shore-lineof odd stuff caught along the fencing, and I half-closed my eyes and imagined thiswas the spot where everything I’d ever lost since my childhood had washed up, andI was now standing here in front of it, and if I waited long enough, a tiny figure wouldappear on the horizon across the field, and gradually get larger until I’d see it wasTommy, and he’d wave, maybe even call. The fantasy never got beyondthat—I didn’t let it—and though the tears rolled down my face, I wasn’t sobbing orout of control. I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was supposed to be.”It could be read as a novel about all of us: we all live as if life is forever, fullyaware that the end can be any moment. Yet we never stop hoping for brightness,creating the beautiful and lusting after the sensual.A strongly recommended book.', ""Not the cover I was expecting. I thought I was buying the blue cover with the text. I'm on the fence if I should return it. The paper quality is like any other paperback. A bit rough, but the spacing and font is legible with enough margins. The book arrived in decent condition too. There's 5 blank pages at the end though.""]";*Kazuo Ishiguro's new novel Klara and the Sun is now available*Shortlisted for the 2005 Booker PrizeKazuo Ishiguro imagines the lives of a group of students growing up in a darkly skewed version of contemporary England. Narrated by Kathy, now thirty-one, Never Let Me Go dramatises her attempts to come to terms with her childhood at the seemingly idyllic Hailsham School and with the fate that has always awaited her and her closest friends in the wider world. A story of love, friendship and memory, Never Let Me Go is charged throughout with a sense of the fragility of life.'Exquisite.' Guardian'A

(If you thought that Catcher in the Rye lacked a plot, you're in for a surprise.) I guess that psychoanalysis was a big deal in the 1950s, and there are noticeable Freudian influences especially in the second half of the book.

Die Charakterisierungen der Figuren sind durchweg gelungen und geben ihnen eine selten erreichte Tiefe.Die Stärke des Romans liegt in der Fortführung und Charakterentwicklung der in den vier vorangehenden DS9-Relaunch-Romanen aufgeworfenen Handlungsstränge und eingeführten Figuren: Mit einem sehr guten Blick für Details und Stimmigkeit führt der Autor die Handlung um Kiras Exkommunikation fort, Kasidys Schwangerschaft und ihr Leben auf Bajor, Taran\'atars Erforschung der humanoiden Lebensweise, die sich anbahnende Romanze zwischen Ro und Quark, ch\'Thanes Streit mit seiner Mutter und seinen Bondmates, Ezris Wechsel vom Counselor auf die Kommandoebene, Bajors Antrag auf Aufnahme in die Föderation - ganz besonders aber das gestörte Verhältnis zwischen Vaughn und seiner Tochter Prynn. Die Haupthandlung (der Aufbruch der Defiant unter dem Kommando von Vaughn zur Erforschung des Gamma-Quadranten) dient nur als Aufhänger für diese vielfältigen Charakterszenen und ist eher nebensächlich.Deswegen eine Warnung: Wer die ersten vier Bände des Relaunches nicht, bzw. die DS9-Fernsehserie nur oberflächlich kennt, wird an ""Twilight"" wohl kein Gefallen finden, denn ""Twilight"" bezieht seine Spannung aus den bekannten Figuren, nicht aus Action oder einer faszinierenden Idee in der Haupthandlung. Auch für Einsteiger in das Star Trek-Universum ist der Roman denkbar ungeeignet, da in sehr vielfältiger Weise auf frühere Ereignisse Bezug genommen wird. Er richtet sich konsequent an treue Fans der Serie, die auch bereits die ersten 4 Relaunch-Romane gelesen und gut im Gedächtnis haben. Auch Lesemuffel im Allgemeinen werden vermutlich von den über 500 eng bedruckten Seiten abgeschreckt sein.Fans der Reihe, die auch die notwendige Geduld haben, sich auf einen längeren Roman einzulassen, werden aber sicher voll und ganz auf ihre Kosten kommen: Wie bereits erwähnt ist die Charakterzeichnung äußerst gelungen und von einer Tiefe, die selten erreicht wird. Trotz des ausholenden Stils bezieht der Roman eine große Spannung aus seinen Charakteren. Die Haupthandlung ist zwar nicht zentral, dennoch aber durchaus gelungen. Der Autor erschafft dadurch eine sehr dichte Atmosphäre. Vor allem aber macht der Roman Appetit auf mehr - zwar wird die Haupthandlung abgeschlossen, aber viele Fragen bleiben offen.Ein rundum gelungener, mitreißender Roman, der den Relaunch großartig weiterführt. Absolut empfehlenswert!', 'My favorite so far of the DS 9 relaunch titles, this one feels like an actual novel and covers a decent amount of time, where some of the other novels feel more like episodes. This also, however, plays against it, as it seems to drag on at times.Other than that, this novel has it all. Action, character development, setting development, decent plot, and truly feels like a continuation of the series.', 'Enjoyed - as always well crafted and researched into the star trek universe.']";A four-book odyssey of space exploration, political intrigue, religious schism, deadly conspiracies and startling revelations, this is Deep Space Nine at its best. The starship Defiant embarks on a three-month voyage of exploration into unknown space, where both cosmic mysteries and inner truths await the crew. Meanwhile those who remain on space station Deep Space Nine face incredible changes in their lives as the planet Bajor moves a major step closer to joining the Federation...  Read more

It tells of his early hard life struggling to survive on the streets of Rotterdam, how he is noticed by a recruiter for the International Fleet (the international military machine assembled to fight against the aliens called the Buggers) a nun called Sister Carlotta, his life at the Battle School space station training to fight in the war against the Buggers and how he becomes the closest confidant and right hand man of Ender Wiggin, the boy who is destined to lead humanity's fight against the Buggers. This was an excellent book and much more in depth than Ender's Game. Bean is an extremely intelligent character (apparently more so than a human being can be) because his genes were altered when he was conceived and a lot of the book is spent in Bean's head so you see just how intelligent he is. The first part of the book, set in Rotterdam, is very good, and you come to care for Bean and the supporting characters such as Poke and Sergeant, and we are first introduced to the murderous Achilles (who I understand will become Bean's nemesis across the rest of the Shadow saga (this was book one)). We then meet Sister Carlotta and Bean's educative process with her is illuminating. Most of the book, however, is set in the Battle School space station (although the book's climax takes place on an asteroid called Eros) and of most importance is the time that Bean spends in Ender's army, for this is when he grows the most as a character and comes to love Ender. I would have liked to see Bean make more friends during his time at Battle School, but nonetheless I really liked this book and it has a happy ending. The author Orson Scott Card claims in this book's foreword that you can read this book without first reading Ender's Game but in reality Ender's Shadow makes more sense if you read Ender's Game first. All in all, Ender's Shadow was an excellent book. Just make sure you read Ender's Game first."", ""The title says it all - this book is a shadow of OSC's master work, Ender's Game.It's not quite as interesting, and it's a bit more thoughtful than the original.In fact,there are many places in the book where it seems the author has really over-thought things, and having this level of explanation is slightly boring and can slow down the story.However, with all that said, I quite enjoyed it. It's interesting to see Battle School and Bean from a different point of view, and it's nice to see some of the other things that go on at the same time.The preface says this can be read first and Ender's Game second if the reader is new to these books, but I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading Ender's Game FIRST.There are lots of spoilers in this book which take away lots of the fun of Ender's Game. Also, a lot of the content is only interesting if you've read EG first.A good book, but it really is in the shadow of Ender's Game."", ""If you loved Ender's Game, then you'll love Ender's Shadow. This book follows the life of Bean from being a baby to the the same place as the end of Ender's Game, but from an entirely different and more analytical point of view, i.e. the mind of Bean. The beginning is gritty and can make for uncomfortable reading as we follow him through the brutal streets of a dystopian future Rotterdam where children are forced to scrap like animals for the tiniest bits of food, there's a hierarchy of bullies and the bullied, and through his great intelligence, Bean flips this hierarchy.There are really 3 main parts to the book, Rotterdam, Battle School, The Comet. We eventually begin to discover just how unique Bean really his, who he really is, how he came to be the way he is and what a great destiny he has ahead of him, as Ender leaves Earth, Ender's greatest commander must apply his intelligence to the issues that begin to arise on Earth in the post Bugger period.I was hooked for the entire Shadow series, where we follow the lives of Ender's Jeesh and even his brother Peter, as they grow in to adults, and it all started with this book. Go for it, you won't regret it!""]";"Orson Scott Card brings us back to the very beginning of his brilliant Ender Quartet, with the novel that begins The Shadow Series and allows us to reenter Ender's world anew.With all the power of his original creation, Ender's Shadow is Card's parallel volume to Ender's Game, a book that expands and complements the first, enhancing its power, illuminating its events and its powerful conclusion.The human race is at War with the ""Buggers"", an insect-like alien race.

It features a nearly perfect blend of horror, drama, comedy, and action that seems both reminiscent of its time (the late '90s and early 2000s) and yet somehow timeless in its ability to entertain an audience.  It's refreshing, therefore, to return to Sunnydale and the world of Buffy with this novel (yes, it was published while the show was still on, but it's a return for me in the sense that I've only just read it).Set sometime in the middle of the show's third season (not that it really matters, as neither the novel nor the show will spoil very much of each other), the book features the usual cast of characters.  One of the things that always makes me nervous about tie-in novels is that they often don't seem to get the characters quite right, but the characters here actually sound like their on-screen selves, so the reader feels very much like they've stepped back into familiar territory.The plot is at once original and appropriate to the franchise, featuring a Big Bad that's big enough and bad enough to justify a full-length novel without overshadowing the show's own villains.  And though most of the characters are high school students, it reads very much like a grown-up novel, including more than a few little in-jokes and nods to people who've been fans of the horror genre for decades.  Indeed, as much as it feels very much like a Buffy episode, it definitely feels a bit more like one of the more horror-heavy ones.  While there are undoubtedly some funny moments, this book emphasizes and highlights the darker side of the franchise, which makes perfect sense given the author is master horror writer Ray Garton.Yeah, one could criticize the book for being a bit too predictable in a couple of its twists and turns, but that never seems to detract from the reading experience.  Despite the fact that I saw much of the ending coming well ahead of time, I still found it to be a page-turner that kept me thoroughly entertained from the first page to the last.  This was the first of the Buffy tie-in novels I've read, but if it's any indication of the overall quality of the series, it certainly won't be the last."", ""The reason I gave this book a low rating is that much it relates to the Big Bad's past 1100 years of life. Also, stupid origin.But the Sunnydale parts were great. People in the town are behaving oddly. Too men who have friends and neighbors for over fifty years begin an argument that ends with one killing the other. And the winner? he's dinner. Case after case of besties turning beasties keep the story rolling. Two teachers get deadly physical with one killing the other in the cafeteria in spite of Oz & Xander's attempt to stop them. The teacher who killed soon became the teacher who was eaten. And then, it happens to Buffy and Willow.So is is the new teacher, Ms. Daruwalla the reason the Rakshasa, minions of the evil god Ravana, are turning friend against friend, parent against child? Willow certainly HOPES not, but she's getting less sure by the day.There is only ONE way to stop this immortal enemy of Rama - and time is running out!"", 'Red eye, morphing, ravenous little Indian (not Native)demons who hide under the bed;ready to turn anyone into non-thinking hateful human beings as the demons rub their bellies in anticipation for dinner.  ""Resurrecting Ravana"" is indeed a dark novel, not for children.  It reads like a horror novel, which one could never turn into an episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Garton doesn\'t insult the Buffy fan reader, by placing reminders all over the place about what the characters did in the past.  It\'s not necessary, because Buffy, Giles and the Scooby gang face several adversaries. Even our favorite daper chap, Ethan Rayne makes an appearance.  Grayston has succeeded in creating a mature novel that definately makes the reader squirm with delight.']";

It begins partly in Rwanda, around five years after the events of the war between the Tutsi and the Hutu tribes. Fr Terry Dunn is posing as a priest, though there is some doubt that he was ever ordained, although that doesn\'t seem to bother anyone and he holds Mass and hears confessions and seems to be the only person trying to help the people of the small town of Nyundo. This is the opening paragraph: ""The Church had become a tomb where forty-seven bodies turned to leather and stains had been lying on the concrete floor the past five years, though not lying where they had been shot with Kalashnikovs or hacked to death with machetes. The benches had been removed and the bodies reassembled: men, women and small children laid in rows of skulls and spines, femurs, fragments of cloth stuck to mummified remains, many of the adults missing feet, all missing bones that had been carried off by scavenging dogs."" With such a nightmare scenario, how can this book even try to be funny? Perhaps `funny\' is the wrong word. It is more, perhaps, taut, ironic, fiendishly clever and starkly shocking, in the scenes set in Africa especially, but the majority of the action takes place in Detroit as Fr Terry travels back for a break with his family and gets embroiled in a scam to raise money for Rwanda. It has a tightly drawn plot, featuring Debbie, a stand-up comedian who allies herself with Fr Terry, his lawyer brother Francis and his sister-in-law Mary Pat. There is a hopeless hit man called Mutt, the mob-boss Tony Amilia, and Debbie\'s ex-husband, Randy, who cheated her out of her hard-earned savings, so she ran him over, and that\'s why she\'s just out of prison. Can she be trusted and can Fr Terry be trusted? Can anyone, in fact, be trusted? Just who is on the level here, and who is going to to come out of this delightful book with their conscience intact?', 'Usual Elmore Leonard high standard  - brilliant.', 'This is a good light read - typical Elmore Leonard.

I was really able to slow down with this book, chewing on each bit of information and incorporating his recommended ideas into my daily walk with God. The concepts he presents in this book are in opposition of what the world says about how women should be (thank God!). It's serves as a great reminder that embracing our God-designed femininity doesn't mean being weak or being a doormat. I don't have to strive to have or be everything; instead I can embrace the fact that God's design for me is enough and God is everything.

Well he is and a pretty darn good one.Daniel is an amiable young man who lives alone in LA. A guy made up of many quirks and foibles who tends to overthink things is trying to romance Zandie from the drug store, or Elizabeth the estate agent [depending what mood he’s in] while try to navigate the streets without crossing a curb and find his own way in the world.Martin does a great job of getting the reader into Daniel’s head. When ODC [implied but never stated] or Asperger’s [possible] characters are portrayed on tv or books they usually come across as cliché or offensive, but with Daniel, he feels genuine and believable.

Some of my favorite bits are Daniel trying to complete a car journey without using the letter e and keeping 1125 watts of power on constantly. Even so, there is a parallel theme of sorrow and the ugly side of life intruding which raises this above a usual ‘humor’ book.The first third is rather directionless but never too slow and gives the supporting characters time to breath.

So, with a fascination for 70s and 80s US comedy, I jumped straight in to this exhaustive look at the show.It starts with a bit of background before launching into the origins of the series. It's constructed in an unusual way - a short passage introduces a series of comments from those involved at the time. Naturally this means that we start off with explanations from the likes of Chevy Chase and Lorne Michaels before going through the Eddie Murphy years, the Chis Farley years and all the way to the latter days of Tina Fey. I'll be honest - only the SNL stars up until about 1990 were initially of interest. Yet with patience even the later years become interesting.What really sets this book apart from its contemporaries and why I would consider it essential reading is its brutal honesty. Very few classic stars come out of it beloved by everyone and it's a good reminder of the feet of clay that invariably support these stars. That said, some people come out of the history with real dignity. Here is a quick key to a few on both sides of the scale.CHEVY CHASE - Well, much as I love Mr. Chase's dry wit and much as I adore the film 'Fletch', the universal feeling is that he is a massive jerk. At one point he even admits it himself!JANE CURTIN - I was very impressed by her. While her surrounding cast were throwing themselves into drugs and needless flings with each other, Curtin did her job and didn't get sucked in. In a very boisterous, competitive environment with people like John Belushi bouncing off the walls, she refused to bend to peer pressure. There's even a wonderful moment when Lorne Michaels had tried to agitate her and it was all water off a duck's back to her. Massive kudos to you, Jane.CHRIS FARLEY - I was never a fan of his over-the-top man-baby antics though seeing his effect on others is interesting. It's also poignant reading his desperation to be 'the funny guy' all of the time. Steve Martin comments on how exhausting it was trying to have a normal conversation with him.PHIL HARTMAN - Universally loved and multi-talented, his tragic death really does seem to have rocked the cast. Again, down-to-earth and confident enough in his own abilities not to get caught up in the nonsense.It is a very long read which might put the casual reader off as may the structure of it. Nevertheless, it is packed with information and interviews; highly recommended for those of us raised in the 80s when nearly all of the performers hear became big stars of cinema."", ""Bought this as a casual bed-time read for myself at Christmas as I'm a huge SNL fan.Whilst I'm nowhere near through it yet, there are nights when I simply can't put it down due to the unbelievably raw and un-edited stories from some of my favourite comedians from the mid-1970s to 2000s.A great read for anyone of a certain age and also if you like any of the John Landis-era movies from Animal House right the way through to Beverly Hills Cop 3, and want to find out more about why certain actors did or didn't get parts!"", ""This book has not be written, in that, its actually just a series of quotes and interviews from past performers and writers grouped together in chronological order referencing different topics. But, it is still a highly informative read and discusses a lot of behind the scenes details. It is great to hear various people discuss other performers and how the show was put together and evolved. The book only loses stars on the rating, because it doesn't feel like you are reading a book. Rather, you are reading a transcript of various conversations strung together as if Bill Murray and Will Ferrell where in the same room.""]";"James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales's definitive oral history of Saturday Night Live, hailed as ""incredible"" (Vulture) and ""required reading"" (People).

It is unique in that each one of the books is set in a different National Park, though there are some doubles.

Saranya (Saranya Umakanthan)Format: PaperbackNo of Pages: 234Publisher: Writing Geeks (1st Ed- 25/09/2018)Blurb: The blurb portion of the book is written broadly while giving a clear idea about the plot and keeping the storyline under the cover. It is sufficient revealing and that’s why I consider this good and apt.Cover: The front cover of the book is interesting & catchy one I can say. Though it could have been better, but as per the base plot of the book, the way it is designed, can surely be termed as ‘justified’.Title: The title of the book is good and highly inspiring I must say. It goes with the theme of the story perfectly. Hence I consider it appropriate for the book.Language & narration: Language of the book is simple and lucid enough to comprehend. There are quite a few places where, the choice of classic words has impressed me often. The story is in 3rd person narrative and the narrating style of the author kept the charm of the book intact till the end. By continuing a plain and simple flow, descriptive narration of the events made the story more connecting to the reader.Plot: This plot has all sorts of elements present, that is needed to develop an inspirational and love story full of motivation. Be it in any aspect, whether it is friendship or family love, it covered every zone and perfectly woven. The main plot is consists of several sub plots too that added cherishing flavor to the story I must say. I will add that there were some places where the plot seemed a bit cliché; it could have been avoided, but overall it is good undoubtedly.Setting: Setting of the story is in Bangalore & Chennai.Characterization: Crystal clear characterization is can be considered as one of the strengths of the book. Each and every character (be it the protagonists or any other supporting) is portrayed visibly clear and all of them are justified to their respective roles till the end. Names of the characters mentioned in the book are- Samaira Ranjan aka Sami, Ashish, Ram, Pariti, Sharmi, Pooja, Vivian Andhera aka Viv, Mr. Sadana, Raghu, Radha, Kushi Vastav, Mr. Ravi, Mr. Vadra, Preeti, Shreya, Praveen, Amar, Dinesh, Guna, Anu, Lakshmi Antie, Vijay, Gauri Andhera, Amitesh Andhera, Pavi, Kavita Ma, Arpit, Baijan, Chitra, Mr. Dasgupta, Bala, Shiv, Laila.Theme: Love, Romance, Friendship, Family Value, Life, Inspirational, Motivational.Story in a nutshell: The story revolves around the lives of two persons and people their surroundings. They are- Samaira and Vivian. Here we go-Samaira was a girl with full of enthusiasm and life. She was not just only the head turner during her college times, but her charming and jolly personality made her adorable and popular in every aspect once. Singing was in her soul and she used to live music through her. Life was quite fare to her till a certain point. But the scenario started to change after his marriage. At a very young age, she faced the cruel side of life through her husband and mother-in-law. After inexplicable humiliations and insult, when she finally was able to get the divorce and thought that life couldn’t be more pathetic, right that moment life threw a much harder stone at her, that was beyond her wildest dreams. Life snatched her parents and brother and made ‘society’ think that she is responsible for that.After losing everything and every single reason to live, when she was completely scattered and broken into pieces from inside out, right that moment, Vivian crossed her path. Vivian was one of the most successful businessman and entrepreneur and the boss of the company ‘Creative Tanks’ aka CT. He was ambitious, determined and he was that type of Man that every girl dreams of. His handsome look, sharp business sense, achieving will, gentle and caring nature and focused behavior and huge success at an early stage made him the most lovable and attractive personality in his surroundings. Vivian had fallen head over hills for Samaira on their first meeting, and it was definitely love at first sight from his side. Destiny brought them together when Samaira joined CT in Ideas Dept of Marketing. In spite of being in Boss-Employee relationship, there was much deeper bonding between them.Vivian already casted his dynamic magic over her and she started realizing it too. But she made herself realize that love was not her cup of tea. Her experience with love already did cost her enough and she won’t allow it to affect her anymore. That’s why she made it very clear to him that she has only friendship to offer him, nothing more than that…But she was not the Samaira she used to be once, and Vivian wanted to break her shell and brought back the old carefree Samira. He wanted to wipe away all her tears and give her all the happiness and love she deserved. Eventually Samira got to know such a truth about Vivian’s past that shook her to the core...What is awaiting their destiny? What was the truth about Vivian’s past that Samaira discovered? Was that the end of the pain that life had to offer or destiny has something else in store for them? Will Vivian be successful to give her the life she meant to get? Will he be able to break her shells and bring her back? Will she ever accept her true feelings about him? Will they ever be able to stay together? To get these answers and to know the rest of the story, grab your copy of the book now and dive in.My Verdict: Authoress Saranya Umakanthan has penned down a touching and inspirational lovely journey indeed. Mixed emotions overpowered me while reading. Smile & tears, it can bring both to the reader’s face and I am sure it will. Life is not a cakewalk for everyone every time; it can’t be. Life has a tendency to throw stones to us when we least expected to, because it wants to see how strong we are. There can be any kind of pain, struggle, loss, sacrifice, and life can make us face anything; it is all about whether we let ourselves down and quit or face them and overcome everything. To achieve something, first we have to believe that we can. God never gives us such pain that we won’t be able to handle. All we need a little push to see beyond the wall and think positively. Love is the most beautiful feeling ever created by God in this world and true love can conquer anything. God never promised us an easy journey but only a safe arrival. True love is worth waiting for and any sacrifices.The pain, struggle, inner fights, dilemma, friendship, genuine bonding, pure and innocent soulful love, care, affection, family love and value, smile, laugh, ambitions, dreams, possessiveness, jealousy, maturity, sacrifice, joy, supportive nature and phases of being in love- each and every thing mentioned above and every shade of emotions are evidently clear in every line of this story from beginning till the end. Each chapter is started with some line of anecdotes from the author and that concludes a very significant message for every chapter. Non- English words are pointed, written in italic fonts and meanings are given at the page end, separately. I cherished reading this book overall certainly.At the end of the day, we have to believe that we can, only then we will and of course we must…Recommendation: I’d like to recommend this lovely book to every avid reader & to every love reader, romance lover, and to the people who loves to read motivational journeys. It is definitely an inspiring one for them.

And if she falls, he will be there to catch her, lift her, and push her again until she flies to stars…” Love…does it mean going around the trees in Switzerland, singing tra-la-la-la in the snow? Is it chanting “I love you” mantra a thousand times a day? Is it about gifting teddies and roses to your partner? Or is it bombarding each other with a thousand and one pings in Messenger from morning till night? Life batters Samaira. Stuck to these clichés, she loses everything…her love, parents, and wealth. Hopeless, she collides against the dynamic boss of Creative Tanks (CT), Vivian, who basically holds great contempt for losers. He aims to be the top entrepreneur in India, whereas Samaira has not even a notion of her dreams. Fate plays its own game when she goes in search of work, where she encounters him again. An air of mystery surrounds her, which tugs at him. Despite being opposites, sparks fly, and they are attracted. Vivian is perfect, but she vows that she will never fall in love again. He reaches a point where he would do just about anything to bring back the smile on her face. The chase begins. She keeps running away…from love, hope, and aspirations, and he keeps trying to bring her back on track. Thus their journey begins from the end, with oodles of inspiration and love… Vivian breaks Samaira’s shell and guides her into pursuing her broken dreams. He promises that he will be there for her if life pulls her down and hold her tight when she needs support. Together, they vow to each other, “We can. We will. We must.” But when Vivian tumbles and it is Samaira’s turn to break his fall, will she catch him? Walking on the arduous path of life, will they climb the ladder of success together or crash and burn? Can love be enough of a catalyst to attain their dreams?

The story follows Leon and Claire as they struggle to survive the horror of the T-virus outbreak in Racoon City.I only had the Wii console and RE2, RE3 Nemesis, RE Code Veronica, etc, aren\'t available on the Wii so the closest I have come is playing\xa0\nResident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles\n\xa0which has an abbreviated version of the story as part of the overall Umbrella Chronicles game. This book fills in the gaps that were left by REDC.  I now have a PS3 as well (which is backward compatible with the PSone games) so I have managed to play RE (I still have a tendency to run Chris Redfield straight into the wall) and an early copy of RE2 and Nemesis, and I can say that,in my opinion as an RE fan, SD Perry has done a masterful job turning the games into novels and sticking as close to the books as she could.The characters are nicely rounded, including other characters that I only know in passing such as Sherry, Annette Birken, Ada Wong and Police Chief Brian Irons.As with the previous 2 book this was a thoroughly enjoyable read. The author obviously misses out the puzzles as she did with the previous game based book Umbrella Conspiracy.These books are a great edition to my collection and a real help towards my understanding of the Resident Evil back story, especially as the games like RE2 are not available on the Wii or the PS3.

There are several of these new characters who ""bite the big one"" but I would have liked to have ""lived on"" and appeared in the future books, but the author had other plans.

Stuck in the middle are a local dog-catcher and the woman he loves, whose secret past haunts her as she fights a bloody one woman battle to save their relationship.If you had told me earlier this year that I would read an entire novel that was written in free verse I would have laughed in your face. If you told me I was going to enjoy it, there is a good chance I would have fallen from my chair. I should try to explain. I don't have much of a relationship with poetry; in fact, I don't read any at all. In the past I have tried, I've been sent poetry collections to review and epically failed to form any sort of attachment with the text. With this thought in mind, you can imagine my surprise when I started reading Sharp Teeth and I not only liked it, but was utterly engrossed.Toby Barlow really seems to have captured the primal nature of the pack with his writing. It also seems such a logical fit to compare the gangs of Los Angeles and their culture with the pack mentality of wolves; both groups seem to behave in such a similar manner. The different werewolf packs prey upon lonely individuals who live on the periphery of the city's society.There are two characters that made Sharp Teeth for me. Firstly there is Anthony, the dog catcher. His story is the emotional heart of the novel. He is utterly destroyed by the events that take place in his narrative and his journey was totally compelling. Anthony is just a simple man who thinks he has found the missing piece of his life only for it to be ripped away from him. I was unprepared for how affecting the highs and lows he lives through would be.The other character that stood out was Lark, the leader of the first pack the reader meets. He is an alpha male in every respect, the very antithesis of Anthony. Lark continually attempts to think three steps ahead of all his enemies. He has plans within plans and it was always interesting to follow him as he spends vast chunks of the novel trying to keep these various plates spinning. He goes undercover at one point and it was great to see how Barlow easily adapted Lark's character and how Lark functioned differently in wolf form. Lark celebrates being a werewolf; he revels in his dual life. To him being a werewolf is almost a religious experience. He is entirely at peace with his place in the universe. It was nice to see a character that bucked the trend of the traumatized, haunted loner.Sharp Teeth proved to be a bit of a bit of a revelation. The text had an almost hypnotic quality and a naturally flowing cadence that made it difficult to pull myself away. There is a wealth of vivid imagery and language that will stay with me for quite some time.This is a modern, insightful story that breathes new life into the werewolf mythos and I can't recommend it highly enough. Based on this experience, I'll certainly be less dismissive of poetry in future. Seek this novel out and read it, you can thank me later."", 'I read about this book in a guardian article on ""summer reads"" and I laughed about the premise when I first saw it. Then I read some reviews and became intrigued. I must admit, had there not been 1p copies I probably wouldn\'t have tried it. I\'ve never read a novel-in-verse and I was fairly sure there was a reason for that.So glad I took a chance though! The premise whilst it initially sounds ridiculous, is actually a very touching and beautifully written book. It manages to be deadly serious about werewolves without ever being ridiculous (which I often find books that try and take fantasy creatures too seriously often are). It took a couple of pages to get used to the style but then I was away and loving it. One of those books you never want to end. I have never read anything like it and I fear I won\'t again.

Yet he measures himself against the tough guys, and we with him (at least, while the story lasts). This creates an endearing sense of youthfulness, enhanced by the occasional lyric description of mountain woods and pre-mechanical skills - such as fly-fishing or packing loads onto a mule.The title piece (published in 1976) is famous amongst a wide circle of literary afionionados, and was given a major popular boost when it was turned into a sensitive and visually beautiful film by Robert Redford in 1992.Redford wrote a Foreword to the University of Chicago 2017 edition of the three stories, which is impressively intelligent and low-key, focused on what it was like to court and work with Maclean, which is just what one wants to know. (Incidentally, Redford has always seemed to me to be rather a fey hero in his conventional movies, slightly uncertain and uncommitted - handicapped by his thoughtfulness? - never fully in the part, in contrast, for example, to Paul Newman and Brad Pitt.)Contrary to what Maclean said about his three tales - that they express 'a little of the love I have for the earth as it goes by' - they seem to me to be overwhelmingly focused on American, male machismo: extolling the 'devil may care' disdain for anything except the hero's old-fashioned sense of personal honour, self-sufficiency and the landscape (in this case, Montana). This is the classic material of Westerns, but with forestry work as the context, instead of confrontations with desperados.The three stories are closely based on the author's early life in Montana in the 1920s. It says something about the enduring patriotism of American critics that Maclean is still acclaimed by many as a great writer on the basis of these slim offerings (he published no other fiction). They are redolent in style and purpose of a homespun Hemmingway, but with less emotional range and little complexity of relationship.Not that the tales are not very good. They are deftly told, and the terse and short dialogues are brilliantly evocative of character. All three stories are about 'strong' men, who may appear slightly simple-minded to our more nuanced and progressive 21st century sensibilities. Above all, it is Maclean's singular and laconic style which attracts, as well as the vision of a simpler, more heroic world. There is also the occasional sighting of an underlying tenderness - close to nostalgia - in the author's relations with his family and, equally, with the straight-forward mountain-lad which he once was.At one point, the author speaks to us more or less directly, in the voice of his father, near the end of A River Runs Through It: 'we can seldom help anybody. Either we don't know what part to give or maybe we don't like to give any part of ourselves. Then, more often than not, the part that is needed is not wanted. And even more often, we do not have the part that is needed.' This opens up a necessary strain of compassion, which redeems the ultimately unattractive self-sufficiency of the main characters.The last story, USFS 1929, is the most dramatic. It's about a mountain-lad of 17 working for 'the finest the early Forest Service had to offer', in the person of the ultra-taciturn, heroically direct Bill Bell. Man and story both exhibit great economy of style. With masterly dexterity, Maclean builds a kind of laid-back tension, leading to a climactic poker game in a mountain town. As everyone expects - and wants - it ends in a sprawling back-room fight which is over minutes after it starts, but not before the lad socks the one member of his own crew whom he can't stand, and gets clobbered by the other side."", 'A great read. Stories of the wild Montana rivers and forests. The River Runs Through It was especially good, fly fishing explained in detail but with scenes of water and trees brought to life with pictures painted by words. A time gone but still desired by all who wish to alone, quite and one with nature with the strength of the wild all around', ""This is is a literary gem, very approachable and extremely poingnant. It is the true story in the form of a Novella, told through the eyes of a much older man, about growing up as a young boy in Montana and his relationship with his strict Presbyterian minister father and wayward brother. As the brothers evolve into young adults all three men's lives diverge; but they remain united by a common passion for flyfishing and the beauty of the virgin Montana countryside of that era - the film of the same name, directed and narrated by Robert Redford is well worth seeing.""]";"When Norman Maclean sent the manuscript of A River Runs through It to New York publishers, he received a slew of rejections. One editor, so the story goes, replied, ""It has trees in it."" Forty years later, the title novella is recognized as one of the great American tales of the twentieth century, and Maclean as one of the most beloved writers of our time. The finely distilled product of a long life of often surprising rapture for fly fishing, for the woods and their people, and for the interlocked beauty of life and art A River Runs through It"

Not spectacular. Interesting insights are there to pick up from.Was somehow expecting more from it.Worth flicking through.', 'The author, William N. Thorndike Jr., has mentioned eight CEOs during whose tenures the returns generated by their shares have outperformed those of industry peers and the broad market by a wide margin for very long duration of time. He considers such CEOs as truly outstanding CEOs and has explored their backgrounds, management approaches and major decisions taken by them to achieve extraordinary returns for their shareholders. Although these CEOs have followed an independent and contrarian decision making (which is why they have been called ‘The Outsiders’), the author has found some similarities among them with respect to their management approaches (especially capital allocation decisions) and their personalities.Although there are no strict formula, the ‘outsider’ CEOs mentioned in the book did the following: They disdained dividends, made disciplined (occasionally large) acquisitions, used leverage selectively, opportunistically bought back a lot of stock at cheap prices, minimized taxes, decentralized operational decisions, centralized capital allocation decision, and emphasized cashflows instead of reported net income. Personality wise these outsider CEOs have been generally frugal, humble, analytical, understated, not-so-charismatic and did not seek much spotlight.The book has been written in a very simple and readable manner and conveys its message very clearly. However, I felt that there may be survivorship bias in author’s viewpoints at several places. Also, I felt that although the book is more informative in nature, it is not highly insightful. There is too much repetition of some aspects such as buybacks, decentralized operational decisions, large & opportunistic acquisitions, etc. I felt that these concepts can be better instilled in the reader’s mind with conceptual explanation rather than repetitive examples, whereas the author has adopted the latter.', 'Interesting book but a little repetitive.

His survival of a vicious attack by a grizzly and subsequent abandonment by fellow trappers and his lone journey back to fort brazeau are well known tales of American frontier folklore.This novel by Michael Punke is primarily a retelling of Hugo glass's survival, but also includes few historical events and personalities. Glass,  employed by the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, sets off on an expedition to the American frontier along with a band of trappers led by Andrew Henry in 1823. The group comes under an attack by a native American tribe, resulting in a few casualties; and the remaining members of the group trek along the Grand River on its way to Fort Union. Scouting for game to replenish their food supplies, some distance ahead of the fellow trappers, Hugo Glass is attacked by a huge bear, leaving him badly mauled.With deep cuts on his throat and most of the upper body, the other members believe his end is imminent and wait for the moment. But Glass surprisingly holds on to life and captain Henry decides to carry him along with them on a litter. Carrying Glass along, they soon realise, is an impediment to their own journey on the dangerous landscape inhabited by various hostile native American tribes. When Henry announces a monetary reward for any two members willing to stay with Glass and see him through, while the rest of the party moves on ahead, two members of the group, John Fitzgerald and Jim Bridger volunteer. Jim Bridger, a young boy, tries his bit to help glass by tending to his wounds. Fitzgerald, on the other hand, is an opportunist with no concern for anyone but himself, and plots to get rid of Glass soon. He is also a murderer and defaulter on the run; joins the trappers only to evade capture.Two days later when Fitzgerald spots a few Arikara mounts, he steals from Glass -his rifle and tools, which might have given Glass a chance of survival on his own - and leaves. Bridger, scared for his own safety, follows Fitzgerald. Glass, rendered immobile because of his wounds, watches their treachery with raging anger within him. He swears revenge on them, and the vow of vengeance feeds his desire to survive against all odds. And he needs to reach Fort Brazeau first, three hundred miles down river.Hugo Glass's life before he turned a frontiersman is briefly described, that also includes an account of his service under a notorious pirate, Jean Lafitte. The novel is not just a tale of revenge, but is also a vivid portrayal of the hardships of life in the wilderness, the savagery of conflict between new explorers and native tribes and desire of man to succeed against all odds.Punke weaves an engrossing story encompassing historical events of adventure and nascent stages of expansion towards the West.

This novel is a retelling of a the German Grail romance Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach which was also the basis for Wagner's opera\xa0\nParsifal\n. Eschenbach's great work is available in a number of translations in including\xa0\nParzival and Titurel (Oxford World's Classics)\n.The original is worth reading, but it is also a long tale with digressions which modern readers may find ponderous and slow. Those familiar with Wagner's opera will find many additional details and twists to the story, perhaps to be fair left out because of the need to compress when adapting things to the stage. It is a tribute to Lindsay Clarke that he manages to retell this great tale, keeping the essential details but in a shorter version. Thus this book might either be read as a primer before going on to Eschenbach's work, or instead of reading the older version. Either way, you wont be disappointed with this more modern retelling which has pace and stile.Clarke signs off the novel as if he were Eschenbach, thus reflecting the original. The story is of the young boy Parzival who is an innocent, pure fool who has a number of misadventures along the way to becoming a knight at King Arthur's court, who then finds it is his destiny to seek the Grail. It is a story rich in symbolism which Clarke explores at the end in essay which forms afterword, with some references for further reading, in which he explains why he sees this as a story of our time.All in all a great read that withstands repeated readings."", 'It was recommended by my therapist, and I just about remember it being a great little story, with a timeless lesson.', 'This is a must read for every seeker.

I came across it by accident at the local library and felt mildly curious about it.  I read the entire book in one (very long) sitting and was so pleased with it that the next day I read it again, savoring little gems of dialogue and observation and subtle humor. It's not a perfect book but it is a book I'll return to because (like the Six Gifts in the story) there is much more to it than first meets the eye.As other reviews have noted, the story (actually, stories within stories) is richly endowed with myth and legend.  I don't know how much of the mythic/fantastic content is a retelling of traditional Chinese folklore and how much of it is direct from Alexander's imagination, but in any case, he brings a refreshingly light and skillful touch to telling stories with deep roots.The book does leave me curious to explore traditional Chinese myths and legends - a vein of folklore with which I'm not very familiar but which based on this book may well hold storerooms of hidden treasures.The story Alexander tells concerns the inner journey just as much as it concerns an outer journey.  There are a number of quotes from Taoist and other mystical tradition that indicate Alexander is aware of this, but he is too good a writer to be heavy-handed about it.Stories in the myth/legend genre risk falling into stereotypical characterization - good guys versus bad guys - and Alexander doesn't entirely escape this.  However, the main characters do do have some complexity and life, they can do unexpected things and they can change.  Even the main Bad Guy has some good traits at the beginning, although by the end he is simply vain and vicious.  The minor characters are fun to read about but for the most part they are streretypical - particularly the greedy merchants, the vacuous officials and the wandering sages.Whether you are reading this book for yourself or reading it to your child you will be glad to know that this book is written with a good heart.  It is an invitation to life, wisdom and compassion told with keen observation and a great sense of humor."", ""A huge fan of Alexander's Prydain stories, I was deeply impressed by the Kestrel series as well.

If you haven't already encountered Kage Baker's Company novels, that's the package on offer.In the twenty-fourth century, The Dr Zeus Company provides artworks and extinct species for rich clients.  The workforce are orphans recruited from the past and upgraded to hyper-performance standard, which includes bestowing immortality on these individuals.  This raises a variety of interesting scenarios the Company series explores, such as; how do humans cope with everlasting life?  What happens when part of your immortal workforce become redundant?Mendoza in Hollywood is the third Company novel, although untangling the chronological order of this series isn't straightforward, demonstrated by the fact that this books has the alternative title 'At the Edge of the West'.  In this book, we are reunited with trained botanist, Mendoza, an immortal employee of The Company, who is sent to an isolated stagecoach station on the site of what will turn into Hollywood.  Living with her at staging post are other Company agents, all working in difficult, but normal conditions.  However, events conspire to ensure that this assignment is anything but routine for the hapless Mendoza...A masterful storyteller, Baker is capable of spinning an engrossing narrative that skips across timelines and slides between her main characters, which she does in other Company novels.  However, this book is in first person viewpoint with Mendoza narrating the events under interrogation, which gives the character an intimacy and immediacy I thoroughly enjoyed.The concept of Time is examined in this book on several levels.  There is the obvious preoccupation of the narrator, a deeply unhappy woman, doomed to an immortal existence.  She is tormented with vivid dreams of her dead lover that have not faded with the passage of time - although we discover during the story the reason why...  Mendoza rescues plant species destined to become extinct during the 1863 drought, alongside her young colleague, Einar, performing the same task with the local wildlife.  In addition, Einar is also huge film fan.  He takes Mendoza on tour around the wild semi-desert countryside, describing where all the famous Hollywood landmarks will be built.  The descriptions are lyrical with nostalgic longing for times gone - both of the landscape and Hollywood in its early heyday.  It's a neat trick to pull off.As relief from their primitive discomforts, the immortal team treat themselves to filmshows of the early epic Hollywood era.  Mendoza describes these evenings in some detail, giving a running commentary on the action and ideas behind the productions - filtered through the persona of a cynical three hundred year old.  As an artefact created in one time-bubble is being consumed in another - how much should we overlay the preconceptions of our own period on such a product?  A highly pertinent question for anyone watching movies produced before we were born.  There is a moving scene when one character suffers an emotional fugue watching Griffith's film 'Intolerance' because she had actually lived through Babylonian times - and unexpectedly encountering a recreation of her own time so many hundreds of years later, was too much to bear.I am conscious that this reads as if 'Mendoza in Hollywood' is a worthy, if somewhat grim effort at exploring the nature of time.  What I've omitted to mention is that the plot provides plenty of adventure.  Moreover, Baker has a sense of humour - and unlike many great science fiction writers - isn't afraid to use it.  The dialogue is sharply witty and Mendoza's acerbic asides often had me chuckling aloud.  In addition, while there are also scenes of great poignancy, there is also some knockabout farcical stuff.  For instance, when a jealous ex-lover goes on a drunken rampage, the efforts of the immortal team to diffuse the situation without betraying their superhuman abilities, is hilarious.However, for me, the shining jewel is the characterisation of Mendoza.  We get to know her deepest fears and recollections, the worst and the best of her.  In an outstanding series - which I've bought as an early Christmas present to myself - this is the best book of them all."", 'Kage Baker\'s rich and evocative writing makes this haunting tale of haunted ""Mendoza in Hollywood"" fascinating.

Emily Jenkins\' winning debut novel, ""Mister Posterior and the Genuis Child"" creates a memorable eight-year-old protagonist in Vanessa, who most endure growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a home where her single mother,Debbie, tries to navigate the currents of consciousness-raising, alternative education and sexual satisfaction.  Vanessa\'s voice rings true; her complex personality invites empathy and her myriad school and home experiences delight, horrify and illuminate.  ""Posterior"" features an impressive, fast-paced narrative which enhances Jenkins\' sharply-etched characters and invests their foibles with sympathy instead of disdain.Vanessa is a sensitive, precocious child who is acutely aware of her marginal status at a progressive, counter-culture, purportedly child-centered school.  Chafing at her suddenly obvious differences, Vanessa alternates between rejecting her distinctiveness and embracing it.  Upon discovering her status as a scholarship student  --  a poor kid from a poor, single-parent family  --  and ingesting a classmate\'s comments on her being different, Vanessa remarks that ""it felt like confirmation of something I had known all along.""Her mother, whom Vanessa resolutely calls Debbie, struggles with her own baggage.  ""The only child of two blisteringly spotless people,"" Debbie rebels through diet and her own steadfast belief in her daughter\'s right to be.  Debbie repudiates her parents\' ""veneer of shiny white happiness"" as she flails away at her solitary life.  Dating a seemingly endless array of losers, Debbie unwittingly increases the velocity of Vanessa\'s maturation by hiring a babysitter, whose adolescent fixation on boys augments a budding curiosity in Vanessa.This desire to know, to question leads Vanessa into conflict with quasi-permissive (but secretly manipulative and lazy) teachers whose premise of allowing children to prgress at their own pace runs afoul of their unwillingness to instruct and guide.  A member of the ""Super Spellers,"" Vanessa includes explicit sexual vocabulary in a hilarious script she was voluntarily coerced into writing.  The episode reveals not only her vivid imagination but also the utter blindness of school authorities to authentic childhood creativity.Vanessa adamantly refuses to perceive herself as a victim, and this core resiliency carries her through the central crisis of the novel:  an exhibitionist whose bare bottom alarms her mother, babysitter and neighborhood but merely amuses her.  Vanessa\'s unflinching belief in herself  --  a self defined by imagination, play and discovery  --  serves as a model of behavior, not just for children, but for adults as well.""Mister Posterior and the Genuis Child"" is vibrant and engaging.  Its author, Emily Jenkins, invests her protagonist with an informed childhood sensibility, one open to hurt and fear, but even more receptive to the wondrous, messy possibilities of life.']";"Thirtysomething Vanessa Brick recalls the life-changing year of 1970, when she was picked as the Super Duper Speller for the Cambridge Harmony School and turned the school into a uproar by following her teacher's advice to ""express herself.""

The next book in the series, Sky Coyote is even better, but it helps to have read this one first."", ""Loved this.  Second time I have read it and still just as entertaining and insightful.  Themes from this seem to be in lots of more recent films etc, didn't realise Kage Baker was so influentiak."", ""Garden of Iden (A Novel of the Company) by Kage BakerI had not previously heard of Kage Baker and was just a bit skeptical about this book but I have read Connie Willis's To say nothing of the dog and after reading the sample of this book decided it was worth the try. I'm delighted that I did because not only does she have the fresh humor that Connie Willis demonstrates, she also has a depth of character and story that are quite compelling.My first warning to anyone starting to read this is that it might be misleading to think that this is a futuristic time travel novel. The bulk of this novel reads more like a period piece with the incidental that time travel and future technology and immortality are integral in the event that stirs the main character into the story. Also it's a clever device that Kage Baker uses to enable her characters to think along anachronistic lines that actually make sense when you consider the whole.To explain-in the future they develop technology to extend life-but are in a hurry to test it without having to wait the length of time it would take to verify first that it appears to work second that there are minimal side effects and third that it actually does work. But then they create time travel and have a host of common people to chose from on which to test this and if it works they just look them up in the present and test them for side effects and such. Presumably after much testing our main character, Mendoza, has the latest greatest with least amount of side effects.Now a number of rules apply here that make the story interesting. They can't change the past-even if they try- so they don't try. They can go to the past and return to the present but can't go to the future- which means those they make immortal in the past have to stay in the past, but that's key to what they want to do anyway. So the premise is that if they find and alter people who have no visible impact on history it won't alter time and no one will know about it because those people were just common folk and there are just so many of those around that it makes no difference.--Sure there might be a hole in this somewhere in real causality but we can overlook that for now--.These past participants are then isolated and trained to preform special tasks for the Company that will result in saving things for the Company to use in the future such as works of art that history never noted or perhaps were mysteriously lost and herbs and plants that had gone extinct and perhaps even some animals that had gone extinct. They would have to be isolated somewhere where they wouldn't be discovered until around the dawn of time travel so to speak. Mendoza is a botanist by training so is intent of getting specific things from the Garden of Iden.These inductees are pumped full of nanites and drugs that make them immortal and it become questionable whether they are any longer human and their isolation makes them weary of and in many cases fearful of the apes known as man. They also have knowledge of history that extends well into the time time travel began so they have all sorts of influence from movies tapes and books that they would otherwise not know about. This leads to some interesting thoughts from Mendoza that seem anachronistic when the reader forgets that she learned all of the history and culture and literature that would give her this knowledge. So even though this takes place in mid 16th century she makes reference to things like Shakespeare and Don Quixote and more. Which means they have to be particularly careful when they are around the normal human animals. What this story is really about is Mendoza's coming to terms with the notion that even though she is immortal she may still be human and it takes an unlikely romance with one of the human animals to bring this to her attention. Still throughout she constantly tries to deny that she might still be human. The reader on the other hand can have no doubts as they see her so easily fall sway to normal human pitfalls and prattles. Basically she's smitten and love sick. Of course since she is brought up to be areligious it makes perfect sense that she fall for a devout Protestant during a time of turmoil in England when the Catholic church and the Inquisition are going to be, for a short time persecuting Protestants and heathens. It's a tragedy in the making.Mendoza is torn between duty to the Company and her job and her love for Nicholas and she vacillates between desire to run off with him and the knowledge that since she is immortal any such relationship would end badly. There is one particular incident when she is dancing with her beloved Nicholas that she is almost resolved to go with him when somehow her own conversation  inadvertently leads to Nicholas having a logical conclusion that removes the possibility for them to run off together. Later there is a suggestion that part of the training imparted on Mendoza is full of subliminal triggers that prevent her from abandoning her work with the Company but Kage Baker's writing is so tight that even so, as a reader, I felt that it might have just been some human part of Mendoza that managed to crash things now and then.Another clever piece of writing in the story is that we never quite cross any pivotal moments that make the history books, creating a sort of leeway for guiding the story where it needs to go.This is a great story for people who like historical fiction and for SFF fans who are interested in immortal beings and time travel; even though it is mostly a sort of comedy tragedy about a romance between a radical Protestant and a Cyborg Atheist set in 16th century England.

It is sort of three books in one. The first story is about the post-WWII defense reorganization and attempts by some to eliminate the Marine Corps or fold it into one of the other service branches.  It is important history and often interesting, but also a bit tedious at times. Gen. Krulak has a hard time hiding his feelings for then-General Eisenhower, and his push to leave all fighting on the ground to the Army.  Gen. Krulak discusses the will of the people being reflected in the decisions of Congress to maintain the Marines as a separate fighting force.  The middle part of the book was by far the most fun. I particularly enjoyed reading about the development of equipment and techniques for amphibious operations and close air support. I also liked seeing names like “Howlin’ Mad” Smith popping up in their pre-WWII roles. Lastly, the Vietnam chapters were highly readable but also sad. Gen. Krulak does an excellent job in providing the Marines' perspective on the Vietnam war."", ""It's easy to lose sight of what your purpose is amidst all the chaos of military life, but every Marine should pursue the level of knowledge that Jim Mattis has acquired through reading.

You will be surprised to read how many of our leaders in the military and a president wanted to do away with the Marine Corps.

Generals don\'t always give credit to their underlings who had the ideas or made a program work. ""Brute"" will give you a tough but remarkable view of Victor Krulak. He was dedicated to the Corps and his own advancement. Victor Krulak lived through much of the important times in Marine Corps history. My impression is his family suffered because Krulak was gone all the time and tried to run the house as if it were an extension of the Corps. The guy was very, very smart and deserves immense credit for his achievements. His leadership, with the help of many others, may have saved the existence of the Corps.\xa0\nFirst to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps (Bluejacket Books)\nOne of his sons became Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.']";"Marine general Victor """"Brute"""" Krulak offers here a riveting insiders's chronicle of U.S. Marines - their fights on the battlefield and off, and their extraordinary esprit de corps.

She was recommended to me by a friend - but not this book specifically. I wasn't sure which book of hers to try out, then I saw this was about mothers/daughters. So I chose it.The author writes with authority - meaning she seems to know the subject matter well. What she has to say via her characters feels authentic and real. I like her descriptions of people, places and things. Not too much - but not glossed over either. Just enough to make you feel like you can see these folks in the flesh and where they live.Much of the story is about a woman who is flying on a plane to go see her sister and mother. She's going to go visit a mother she's been estranged from for many years. During her flight she has plenty of time to think about the past and why she has certain feelings about her mother. There are some of us out here in the world that have very close relationships with our mothers - or had that when they were alive.Yet, many of us, did not have a great relationship. Maybe it was strained for many reasons. Maybe our mother just didn't live up to our expectations. Or perhaps she made repeated mistakes or one huge mistake. Whatever, it was, it effects a daughter for the rest of her life. Especially if one does not work hard to fix the relationship.I like the fact that this book has a solid ending. Nothing is left to the imagination. You don't have to fill in the blanks. A pet peeve of mine is when authors leave things unfinished. I know that's a writing technique that's kind of popular now days. But I don't find it satisfying. When a book ends, it should end with no strings dangling, in my opinion. A start, and a finish. Unless there's going to be a series...then that's different.The reason I enjoyed this book was that I could easily related to it. The relationship between the 2 sisters was realistic. In fact that was the best part and the main theme of the story. How they got along as children and the mutual experiences they had together that made for a lasting bond and friendship.  Their questions and their guesses as to what happened to their parents. Then years later they learn some things that they, as children, were not aware of - things that were important & would've made a difference in how they felt had they known.I don't like doing spoilers - so I'm not going to tell you this happened or that happened or they had a neighbor who was like this. Don't ruin it for yourself by reading other reviews that tell you so much about the book in that way. Just read it and have some surprises along the way.I read this directly after reading Mary Trump's book about the president. Which was totally different. That's what I like to do. If I read a long technical or boring book, then I like to follow it up with a story that's light hearted and fun or just anything that's opposite of what I read before.  For me, this was an easy read where you didn't have to use deep thinking or analysis. It's wasn't overly emotional. Although, it may stir up some feelings if you've had similar issues within your own family.I now will continue to read more from this author and will look forward to her other books Thank you for allowing me to write a review on Amazon."", ""Nancy Berg's review of this book is ludicrous. There is nothing plodding nor predicable in this novel. Elizabeth Berg knows human nature well and knows how to deftly present it.This is one of the best novels I've read this year, and I'm probably at about 75 or so by now. I can imagine that some modern women may not be able to relate to the fact that once upon a time it wasn't so easy for women who were talented to channel that energy into anything other than marriage and raising children. I guess that might have been the plodding part for Nancy Pearl. Well, once upon a time, there were not a lot of options, and Berg does a fabulous job of defining those times and what the constraints of those times did.""]";Do you ever really know your mother, your daughter, the people in your family?

Informative behind the scenes history.', '[Warning] This penguin reprint book has been originally published as ""Historical Enigmas"" in 1974, and before that, partly as ""Historical Whodunits"" (1955) and ""Enigmas of History"" (1957).  Beware before buying it.The new title ""Who Was the Man in the Iron Mask"" is misleading, so let me correct it.  The writer Hugh Ross Williamson, prolific novelist and historian (and many others), has written this interesting book about English history, in which he explores the scandals and gossips such as the speculated identity of the father of Elizabeth I, or the murderers of the princes in the Tower.  So, the book is mainly about the history of England, not France.The contents are: 1.History and the Writer 2.The Death of William Rufus 3.The Princes in the Tower 4.The Identity of Perkin Warbeck 5.The Parentage of Queen Elizabeth I 6.The Murder of Amy Robsart 7.Holyrood and Kirk o\'Field 8.The Gowrie Conspiracy 9.The Gunpowder Plot10.The Murder of Sir Thomas Overbury11.The Poisoning of King James I12.The Assassination of Colonel Rainsborough13.The Executioner of King Charles I14.The Campden Wonder15.The Mystery of James de la Cloche16.The Man in the Iron Mask17.The Murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey18.The Innocence of Sir John Fenwick19.The Appin Murder20.The Diamond Necklace21.The Wives of King George IV(Chap.1 is a rather preachy introduction you can skip over.  Chap. 3 is indirectly about Richard III; Chap.16 is of course about the mysterious man in Dumas\' famous novel (or DiCaprio\'s movie), and the proposed theory is certainly unique.  Chap.19 concerns partly RL Stevenson\'s classic novel ""Kidnapped""; and Chap.20 deals with the interesting case about the necklace which accelerated the downfall of Marie Antoinette, recently made into a picture starring Hilary Swank.)And don\'t be wrong here.  Williamson postulates, but never insists.  Like many books on the truths of, say, Jack the Ripper, he shows many intriuging aspects of many well-known episodes in English history, but some people, especially academic historians, would find the book too clever.  To his credit, Williamson, who seems to heartily dislike ""textbook history"" and ""historical propagandas,"" does not offer any conclusive theories about these matters.  He just suggests, but to some, too strongly.It is true, however, that there were scandals and rumors surrounding these cases above, and people are still intrigued by the enigmas in history.  And like the tantalizing questions such as ""Who shot down the Red Baron?"" or ""What ever happened to the still missing author of ""The Devil\'s Dictionary,"" the answers will never be revealed.  This conclusion, Hugh Ross Williamson is, and all of us are, ready to accept.Some complaints about this reprint.  As there is no introduction attached to the text, we don\'t know whether or not new information has been unearthed since the original publication of the book.  We need the opinions from the thrid party, hopefully from historians, but we are left alone to judge the authenticity of the book.  (And this complaint goes to this Penguin Classic History series in general.)I know I cannot use the book in history class in school, but still I find it very interesting.  But I also know that I am no historian.  Read it as a detective\'s dossier.']";Who was Elizabeth I's father? Did Buckingham poison James I? Who was The Man in the Iron Mask?

It delves into the psyche of woman who has been uprooted from her natural surroundings and thrust into a world and a life not of her choosing.Brick Lane is the story about Nazneen, a young woman from a village in Bangladesh married off to a man in the UK who is much older than herself. This is the story of Nazneen's journey of self-discovery in which she goes from being a naive immigrant housewife resigned to her fate, to a woman determined to live her life and raise her family on her own terms and attaining financial independence in the process. In a nutshell, it is the quintessential tale of 'finding your feet' albeit one told from a perspective that is conspicuously absent from modern literary fiction. I would also like to warn all potential readers not to make the mistake of taking this work of fiction to be an authoritative source on the experiences of the Bangladeshi and/or the minority diaspora in the UK. If you want to learn about that, I would recommend you to take up a case study by sociologists and anthropologists. The dominant issues tackled in this book are: the immigrant experience in the UK (specifically that of a young village girl), infidelity, culture-clash, racial tensions and generation-gap.The themes explored are universal ones although the story specifically deals with a Bangladeshi homemaker whose entire existence revolves around nurturing and caring for her family. People from the West might be appalled and balk at the life of a woman from the Third World.  Indeed, some might even make the argument that the lives of the women described in the book are nothing but glorified slavery. But this is a life-affirming story where people overcome the hand that they've been dealt by life and fight to provide for a better future for their children. Isn't this the reason why most people migrate to the West and the First World in the first place?Some of the themes explored by the book are fate, destiny, fatalism, the nature of relationships between man and wife, mother and children, family and neighbours, the feelings of rootlessness experienced by immigrants, drug-addiction, friendship, religious identity, and so forth."", ""Now I am not read this book ...but this book looking very nice .

While Grand Avenue is not quite picaresque, it pays homage to the form by presenting the reader with an ambitious number of twists, turns, plots and sub-plots. JF's ambition pays off and then some. As if by magic, she is able to keep four major narratives in the air, while tossing in at least four more that are smaller, yet equally significant. A feminist novel in the accessible-yet-profound manner of Mary McCarthy's The Group, GA addresses women's issues, often frightening (battery and rape) and heart-breaking (infidelity, the plague that is breast/ovarian cancer) while ceding the point that even within close, supportive groups, like this GOP, friction and betrayal often lies. As with every one of her books, and her oeuvre is impressively large, GA is compulsive reading. It is also her best novel, filled with crisp, funny, sharp language, utter candour and exact and exacting realism. Her deft management of the plot/s showcases her often-undervalued literary talent, and ultimately, and I am thinking of its conclusion, it is a book that will move you (unless you are cynical or dead) to tears without pandering or relying on tried and true formulae. The last scene is so beautiful, so breathtakingly clever in its management of concluding a book of this magnitude, that it is nothing short of an artistic marvel.

As our bodies, our machines, our contrivances. Decay is Sebald's fascination, not a morbidity but an accuracy.

What it's not is a tale of political corruption at the Watergate building and the fallout it leaves - any mention of this is en-passant and incidental. What the book is, is a visceral satire on the lunacy and precariousness of capitalism as experienced through the life and times of one Walter F Starbuck. Vonnegut's anti-hero sails through a life that is gilded and rich at times, penniless and jail-housed at others, with no chart to guide his rudderless ambitions. He just floats and drifts, the subject of happenchance and coincidence, on the murky waters of a sea of stocks and shares and other peoples money. Around him the failed just drown.This is the least inventive and the most polemic of his novels that I have read, in fact it reminded me of George Orwell at times. There are some flashes of his electric prose and coruscating wit but this is pretty much a traditional story in a modish format. I felt there were some faults in the structure; the prologue is laboured and overlong and a lot of the body of the book felt like a series of staged set-pieces interconnected. Still, worth the read as it's still a Vonnegut, even though he's not wearing his Sunday  best"", ""Reading Vonnegut is not quite like reading most authors. At times, it's more like sitting in a room with a knowledgeable but perhaps slightly crazed older relative. The more time you spend with him, the more entertaining he becomes, and the easier it is to slip into the right frame of mind to get the most from the experience. This book flows well, and I'm inclined to agree with those who think it's a good potential starting point for those new to the author. For sure, if you like this, you'd probably enjoy others. This is funny throughout, but still has thought provoking political satire in reams. Several hours of fantastic enjoyment for me, like no other."", ""I have read a few Vonnegut books and I have l liked all of them to some extent, and this was no exception. This was an easy read, had Vonnegut's trademark satire and whit and was good fun. It didn't have much of a story except for one man's history and that didn't really have anything particularly exciting as such.

Many of them were negative.  Douglas Adams was depressed when he wrote it.  The ending was terrible.  And so on.Personally, I thought this was a great book.  In saying that I refer you to the following paragraph from Mostly Harmless:“We live in strange times.  We also live in strange places: each in a universe of our own.  The people with whom we populate our universes are the shadows of whole other universes intersecting with our own.”We see the truth of this statement every day on the review pages of Amazon and Goodreads.  People seem to look out on the same universe. However, there's a clue to the reality of multiple dimensions in the fact that good books in one universe are bad in another.  Mostly Harmless takes - for me at least - a thrilling trip through alternative universes.Mostly Harmless begins and ends with the story of some interstellar explorers called the Grebulons.  A meteorite damages their ship, resulting in the loss of all stored memories.  The crew know they set out to monitor something, but have no idea what.  By chance, they end up on a planet in the outer reaches of Earth’s solar system monitoring the only material they can find to monitor - TV shows beaming out from Earth.  Cagney and Lacey and M*A*S*H seem to be particular favourites.  The Grebulons’ situation contrasts with that of the Vogons who hove into view as the book comes to its conclusion.  The Vogons know exactly what their purpose in life is.  If you compare the clear, small-minded and unpleasant purpose of the Vogons, with the benign TV watching aimlessness of memory-deprived Grebulons, things look different vis-a-vis the aimless TV viewing.  The best lack all conviction; the worst are full of passionate intensity, as Yeats would have said.  It’s like there’s an alternative universe where casual TV watching is a deeply meaningful activity, as is reading books that some people think are not very good.I send this message from my universe to yours - Mostly Harmless is a great book."", 'I read the five books back to back and in my opinion Mostly Harmless is by far the least enjoyable of the series. The book feels very different from the others, almost as if someone else wrote it. It’s a fractionally longer book but has significantly fewer chapters. It’s slower, less interesting, and has far less ‘crazy’ stuff happening. Looking at the timeline, the first 4 books were released in a 5 year period whilst this one had an 8 year wait and you wonder how much of an impact that had on the writing. The last quarter of the book does pick up and feels much more in keeping with the other books, it’s just a shame the majority is so laboured. What I would say is that the bit with the king is well executed and whilst not up there with the biscuit eating scene in one of the previous books it is quite satisfying.']";Douglas Adams is back with the amazing, logic-defying, but-why-stop-now fifth novel in the Hitchhiker Trilogy.

Easy to read and enjoyable.', 'I read the whole book, hoping for something I could use in our personal homeschool journey and didn\'t find anything, turned out to be a waste of my afternoon.  This book is more for people that are using the unschooling or child-led modality of homeschooling.  She suggests that just about everything your teen does while awake counts as school, for instance chores=home ec, watching a movie can be counted as science or history, talking with a grandparent about their youth = history, etc.  She stresses that teens have 4-10 hrs a day of free time to follow their personal interests.  I have very academic, traditional approach to homeschooling with the goal of preparing my kids for college level work and I didn\'t find this book helpful.  Plus, my kids are very introverted and happiest with their nose in a book, they don\'t want or need lots of social interaction.  They do get some of course and have some friends, but they\'re not your typical teens with a highly active social life and need to be on the phone everyday for hrs or out hanging at the mall or whatever, which this book seems to cater to those types.  It seemed to me to be a how to squeeze a little school into their busy lives, instead of how to give them a quality education that prepares them for college academic level and study habits that will serve them well their whole life.  In fact some things shocked me.  She said the bulk of families she interviewed don\'t teach spelling and rely on spell check on the computer and most think cursive handwriting isn\'t important for their kids to learn.  That surprised me.  I think neat handwriting and being able to spell well are important for positive first impressions we have to make in life and being able to write well is essential in our modern era, we don\'t always have access to a computer and printer when we need to write something.  Plus, if you don\'t teach cursive, how will they be able to read it when they see it?  Also, I am against using all the kids activities as ""school"", public schooled kids do chores at home too, and it doesn\'t count as school for them.  Colleges look at math, science, history and english primarily, everything else is elective and extracurricular.  How my kids use their free time is what I consider ""extracurricular"", none of it counts as class time, while it\'s still important for their growth and well-being, it\'s not academics.  Basically, my only complaints with this book are personal opinion differences and nothing against the quality of the work she put into the book, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  If you have similar mindset to me, then don\'t waste $ on this book like I did, borrow a copy and skim it or pass on it altogether.

I lost my edition so I need it.', ""I first saw the film of The Man Who Fell To Earth when I was young and impressionable. However, now I think Nic Roeg was one of those directors (like Peter Greenaway) who seem to think that obscurantism and excess confer intellectual gravitas. I may also be the only person in the world who thinks David Bowie was an over-rated, over-hyped artschooly poseur (I went to art school myself, so I recognise one when I see one) and no better an actor than he was a singer.The book is very different from the film. Its sparse style makes it all the more affecting, since less is more. The tone is wistful, melancholic. Newton is a tragic figure whose very intellect, double that of humans, ensures his isolation. I empathised with him and with Bryce, and loved Betty Jo (portrayed in the film, predictably, as half her real age) and of course the cats. The story is bleak. Since it was written in the 1960s (and btw I find the 'updating' unnecessary and somewhat patronising) it's become less likely that humanity will blow itself up with nuclear weapons. Instead, we're committing slow suicide by destroying our planet through greed and stupidty. Plus ؟a change...  No wonder Newton gave up and took to drink."", ""One of the finest sci-fi's I have ever read. Sharp, poignant examination of the human condition through the eyes of an alien who is 'turning native' against his better judgement. I have seen the film - once before reading the book then after reading the book - and, while I agree that the late great David Bowie was perfect in the role of the main character, I have to say that I believe a British film producer would have stuck more closely to the novel. The numerous flamboyant (and pointless) sexual romps were not even suggested in the understated prose of the novel. Anyway, get the book, read it and despair that such elegant and stylish prose are a rarity in much of modern fiction, sci-fi or otherwise.""]";“Beautiful science fiction . . .

I cannot say that about Phthor. I simply did not remember anything from the first read except it was continued in the story that is built around the Minionettes, sirens of unnatural beauty. Like Chthon, it is brutal.  This time, we see the use of Norse mythology and Ragnarok as a parallel to what Aton's son Arlo is experiencing as the favorite of Chthon.  We see Aton is now a resident of Chthon, with his human wife, sick from the incurable Chill.  We see a preadolescent Minionette that captures Arlo heart, and later why Chthon, who turns out to be as a sentinel being,  tried to destroy her when she first came on the scene.

Arlo has his own encounter with a Minionette, and naturally destruction is upon him and all with whom he associates.

Since then, I have read most of her books, both historical and contemporary fiction, and loved them all, although Shades is still probably my favorite. I pre-ordered The Lion of the South, really excited about the prospect of reading Jessica’s newest work. The timing was perfect for me, the book being released a couple of days before I left for a trip that included visits to the National Civil War Museum and Gettysburg. Unfortunately, I found this latest title disappointing. The writing was certainly up to Jessica’s usual high standard, the research thorough, but like some of the other reviewers, I have read The Scarlet Pimpernel and have also seen the movie (1930s version with Lesley Howard) several times. If this had not been the case, I would have enjoyed the Lion and most likely given it five stars even though the characters were not quite as well developed as in Jessica’s other titles, but the plot had so many similarities to the Scarlet Pimpernel, there was little suspense or story twists for me. Even without the reference to The Scarlet Pimpernel in Amazon’s synopsis, there were just too many déjà vu moments for me not to recognize the plot.  It is true the setting is different, United States Civil War versus the French Revolution, but both title characters pretend to be something they are not to avoid the discovery of their secret identities (SP a foppish, unintelligent individual, Lion a drunk), coffins are used in the rescue of prisoners, both female main characters are told their brothers would be executed if they did not help discover the identity of the Lion/SP, the poem “They seek him here…” is featured in both stories, plus other similarities. TV shows, and perhaps books, use “ripped from the headlines” plots all the time, so I would not have been as disappointed with all the similarities if The Scarlet Pimpernel was based on a true story, not a work of fiction.

Vonnegut rejects the entrenched view that a human is master of his/her domain and that we exist as part of a deep and well-reasoned plan. Vonnegut’s protagonist, Malachi Constant (a.k.a. Unk,) spends much of the story, literally, being controlled by unknown forces via the combination of a brain-shocking device and memory erasure.

(Note: the Tralfamadorians morph a bit between the various books that they appear in, or at least different information is revealed as is relevant to the story at hand. In “Slaughterhouse-Five,” the emphasis is on the fact that this alien race sees all time simultaneously.) While the Tralfamadorians here still see all of time simultaneously, what is emphasized is that they’re a species of robots that came about when the original (biological) Tralfamadorians kept off-loading less meaningful work to robots. But biological Tralfamadorians would always come to believe that whatever work remained didn’t feel sufficiently meaningful. When they finally asked an AI to calculate the absolute most meaningful work there is, they were told that there is no meaningful work, and so they have the robots end their existence. Vonnegut’s wild creativity can have the flipside of being challenging to follow. Fortunately, understanding of this novel doesn’t rest on understanding the workings of the “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” but rather on much simpler and more humorous concepts. Like “Cat’s Cradle,” I found this novel easier to follow than Vonnegut’s time-jumping masterwork “Slaughterhouse-Five.” This is a hilarious and thought-provoking book. I’d highly recommend it for all readers.', ""I must confess up front that this is my favourite book & so was always going to receive 5 stars. I first read 'The Sirens of Titan' when I was sixteen (in 1976) & it has remained as my first choice ever since. I have read other Vonnegut books but this is the clear front runner for me. A science fiction book that reads like a fairy story, it concerns the roller-coaster life of one Malachi Constant, born the richest man on Earth. Through his adventures we learn the 'true' history of mankind both past and near future. This book is rare in that it is word perfect - not one sentence has been added as padding, every character, every verbal exchange, every description adds to the story. It has the barbs of irony that Vonnegut is famouse for but is counterpoised by moments of immense beauty. Plenty happens in this book & it has so much drama that by the end you feel you've been on a long journey. I still feel strong emotions when I read this book & I'm happy that this audio version is now available. The narrator does a good job (of course it can't match the voices I've had for it in my head for several decades) & this makes a big difference.""]";When Winston Niles Rumfoord flies his spaceship into a chrono-synclastic infundibulum he is converted into pure energy and only materializes when his waveforms intercept Earth or some other planet.

Unlike On a Pale Horse, this book did not have a solid lead character or a witty interchange with the main antagonist.  I had much higher expectations for this book, as the character of Chronos (Time) has so many possibilities for adventures through time, but the book only delivered a series of odd adventures through space.The beginning is dull, with an overlong backstory for the lead that does nothing to get the reader on his side.  It takes roughly 20% of the book just to get into character, and even that moment fizzled into a bare sentence of taking hold of the Hourglass.  From that point, the book bounces equally between silly and confusing episodes.  It appears Piers Anthony got caught up in the Star Wars / Star Trek hype of 1983, as he devotes whole chapters to Chronos taking trips to ""other planets"".  Although this is slightly cleared up near the end of the book, at the time the readers can\'t help but shake their heads and wonder why this book is relevant.By the end of the book, the final battle between Chonos and Satan is a yawner.  There is no exciting exchange of ideas, no witty dialogue, and no grand release when the hero wins the day.  It\'s more a relief that the story is over.For a book with such promise, it\'s saddening that the most interesting character is the ring.', 'Wo das erste Buch der Reihe noch vor neuen Ideen und Einfallsreichtum strotzte, ist dieser Teil ein trauriger Groschenroman, der sich aller Klischees bedient, die es im Fantasy/Mystery Genre so gibt.

And again, Piers Anthony adds to his gripping plot a serious, though-provoking study of good and evil. When life seemed pointless to Norton, he accepted the position as the Incarnation of Time, even though it meant living backward from present to past. The other seemily all-powerful Incarnates of Immortality—Death, Fate, War, and Nature—made him welcome. Even Satan greeted him with gifts. But he soon discovered that the gifts were cunning traps. While he had been distracted, he had become enmeshed

However, now I think Nic Roeg was one of those directors (like Peter Greenaway) who seem to think that obscurantism and excess confer intellectual gravitas. I may also be the only person in the world who thinks David Bowie was an over-rated, over-hyped artschooly poseur (I went to art school myself, so I recognise one when I see one) and no better an actor than he was a singer.The book is very different from the film. Its sparse style makes it all the more affecting, since less is more. The tone is wistful, melancholic. Newton is a tragic figure whose very intellect, double that of humans, ensures his isolation. I empathised with him and with Bryce, and loved Betty Jo (portrayed in the film, predictably, as half her real age) and of course the cats. The story is bleak. Since it was written in the 1960s (and btw I find the 'updating' unnecessary and somewhat patronising) it's become less likely that humanity will blow itself up with nuclear weapons. Instead, we're committing slow suicide by destroying our planet through greed and stupidty. Plus ؟a change...

This story hugely focuses on the concept of death and life, of redemption and resurrection. Taking place in two cites; Paris and London at a time when the people were living under the kings like petty insects with a thirst for revenge rising in their midst. Dark secrets brewing behind the rising blood of the French Revolution, we get an in depth view of the state of the common innocent people who got stuck in between this bloodbath.The story opens by describing the situations in France and England as Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a respectable banker of the Tellson\'s Bank, a businessman through and through is on his way from London to Dover where nobody trusts anybody. They are stopped by a messenger looking for Mr. Lorry, who returns the message he received by sending his own, ""Recalled to Life"" And thus, the idea of resurrection began.This tale doesn\'t just draws us in the lives of these characters which have been woven and knitted so delicately it also gives us an understanding on the human nature. It shows us how the thirst for revenge can turn into the reason why the revenge was seeked. Madame Defarge, a very important character in this book is shown to be silently knitting all the time, but keenly hears and sees everything happening around her. The knitting she does is a very important aspect of the story. Dickens tries to throw this back to the Fates in the Greek Mythology, where the three fates knit the fates of people and when a person is to die they cut off a string. The same way Madame Defarge keeps knitting with all of her sisterhood the fates of the people she believes has done wrong to her and her beloved. She wants to damn a whole family and see them dead even if not all of the are guilty. Her thirst for revenge grows so much that she wants to vanquish the line altogether.""The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.""The wine here represents the blood of all those innocents upon whose back the French aristocrats built their lives. It foreshadows to when the people of France would rise up as one and turn the tables against said aristocrats.The three main characters in this story that draw all the strings of the tapestry together are; Lucie Manette, daughter of a doctor who was unfairly put into the Bastille for 18 years to be forgotten is seventeen when introduced in the year 1775. She has always thought herself an orphan until Mr. Lorry, an old friend of Dr. Manette tells her that her father is alive and is at the residence of the Defarges who had been in service to the doctor a long time ago. Hearing this Lucie and Mr. Lorry go and find Dr. Manette in a state where he doesn\'t even remember his name. All he knows now is the name of his cell and to make shoes. They find him bent over his work with barely any light coming through. He is not in a fit state of mind and neither Mr. Lorry nor Defarge, the wine seller and husband to Mrs. Defarge can get anything out of him. But when he sees Lucie he stops working and actually looks at her. Her presence calms him and recalls him to life. They go back to England with Mr. Lorry as their escort where they live in a small house in Soho.The story reopens five years hence with the love interest, Charles Darney who is being wrongly accused of treason in England. Charles Darney\'s biggest secret plays a huge part in the story as he is part of a family of French aristocrats, the same family that had been responsible for Dr. Manette\'s long imprisonment. Sydney Carton, the brilliant yer dissolute alcoholic English lawyer gets Charles aquitted.Onto, the third character who plays a highly important role we are introduced to a young Englishman; Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton\'s character is one of the most complex one. He is in love with Lucie Manette who he knows he can\'t have so he makes a pact to keep her and all those she loves safe. All through the book Sydney thinks of himself as a damned soul and looks for redemption.""To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.""This pretty much summaries the condition of both the cities during the time of when the book takes place. Everything looks good when you see it from afar but when you look closely you just realise how wrong the world truly is.""I tell thee,"" said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, ""that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing.""This has been said by Mrs. Defarge and shows the readers how muchthe thirst for revenge can destroy a person from within. That once this fire starts it is next to impossible to ever stop it. It just wants more and more. It always keeps advancing, always keeps growing. This is a way for the author to warn us against going down this road.""It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued""This represents how the seeked peace but could never could quit grab onto it because it always seemed just out of reach. Mankind has always been prone to destruction and this is no different. To achieve absolute peace is just an idealist though and not a realistic one.""For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.""This quote describes how Lucie Manette, was feeling the brewing of a storm that was to strike soon on her happy life with her family. The echoing footsteps she heard, of the danger to come would disturb her greatly even though her life was well and good until then.""Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning""The answer for violence is never violence and the answer for death isn\'t death because the French Revolution had taken a turn and a sharp female, newly-born called La Guillotine had arrived and a new kind of bloodshed had started in which Lucie and her dear family got stuck without having done any wrong.""For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.""The story is so incredibly woven together that you won\'t understand everything until the very end when it will all come to sense. Charles Dickens has a fascinating wat of story telling that it puts you in the same place as the characters and makes you live the story. You can feel the grief and the pain of what the characters are going through and the poetic writing style wants you to never leave the book alone. And nothing but a quote from this book itself can represent how I felt reading it:""No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.""', ""The book is a treasure for readers.

The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy.""If publishers make an effort not to publish books on acertain subjects, it is not for fear of prosecution, but for fear of public opinion. In this country, intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face. , and that fact does not seem to have received the opinion it deserves. "" - George OrwellA few years ago I read ""1984"" and was totally fascinated by the originality of the novel written by Orwell. It seemed to me a narrative full of current scenario in a context that does not differ much from what happens in our time. So I decided to continue reading his works and this must be the next one.Animal Farm is a satirical novel. Through an allegory, Orwell tells us about how the Soviet regime corrupts socialism with the arrival of Stalin. Throughout the book we will see how the rebellion evolves and how it gradually ends up becoming a tyrannical dictatorship. The characters are the most successful (based on real), they leave us endearing, eloquent and sometimes even funny moments, all thanks to some exquisite dialogues.It is obvious that this narrative contains a double meaning or a double reading, one of them is about corruption, after the acquisition of power of the pigs they become greedy and totalitarian. What has been most significant to me is the mention of how the pigs (rulers) are changing the commandments of the animals and how they convince them that they were like that from the beginning.Summary of the book:The story goes that Eric Blair, the real name of George Orwell, had a hard time finding a publisher that would dare to publish ""Animal Farm."" And it was not for less, given that the very particular way in which he satire the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent rise of communism from which the future Soviet Union would emerge was a challenge that more than one editor did not dare to face.Intelligently, Orwell describes us that through the ideas equipped by a pig nicknamed the Old Commander (Karl Marx), the animals expel the farmer Jones (the Tsar) who controlled his farm normally (Russia) and from the expulsion of the humans in the Battle of the Stable (Bolshevik Revolution) and in which the new system of Animalism (Communism) is established that will lead to the animals now controlling the ""Solar Farm"", renamed ""Animal Farm"".In charge of all this rebellion will be the pigs Napoleon (Stalin) and Snowball (Trotsky). They will end up subduing the rest of the lower animals and will control them with an iron hand, they will make them work tirelessly, rationing their food and subjecting them to the hardest and most extreme work.Soon, the difference between Napoleon and Snowball will be evident, as it happened with Trotsky and Stalin. You only have to read a little of how Trotsky ended up after the persecution of Stalin to understand a section of the Farm Rebellion. It is surprising that Orwell has excluded the personification of Lenin in the novel, since he was one of the key elements in the Bolshevik revolution.The animals, victorious and happy, control the farm. Every day the emblematic song Beasts of England (The Internationale) is sung, the seven animal commandments are coined, the speech ""Four legs yes, two legs no!"" and a green flag (communist red) is raised that identifies all the animals in the center of which they paint a hoof and a horn (the hammer and sickle). The (horror) show is served. The tension will rise, the problems will multiply and what we all know will quickly happen: the pigs, guarded by ferocious dogs that were raised apart by Napoleon to guard his wicked orders, will transform the lives of other animals into a true hell.I am pretty sure that Roger Waters was inspired by this book to compose the songs for the album ""Animals,"" by Pink Floyd and where he divides Humanity into three races: pigs as the leaders who have power, dogs, as an army of fierce guardians and sheep as the submissive enslaved people.In conclusion, Animal Farm is a novel that, like all the classics, transcends time, and does so in a wonderful way. It is contradictory to say, but through a simple group of farm animals, George Orwell represents humanity in all its splendor, with the most tragicomic defects that characterise us. And it certainly makes you think about it. It\'s amazing what can be developed in a few pages and without pretense of greatness - those are the best writers.read more book reviews @ rajulsingh.in', 'I started reading Animal Farm with a prejudice that I incurred through my academic career as a teacher of English Literature. I mean, the allegory stuff. The matter of solidified criticism in the book is the communist totalitarianism in Europe. However, this view received a serious self-analysis as I reached Chapter-3. I realized that George Orwell has created a marvel of literary art with his animals that ran a farm in England. The animals spoke English too, and like many other instances like hoisting a flag or singing an anthem, it didn\'t feel odd. The ""fairy tale"" model has worked immensely for Mr. Orwell. A Fairy Story is the subtitle of Animal Farm,and aptly so. This subtitle not just gives a space for philosophical discussions, but it also renders to the story technical perfection. How efficiently George Orwell represented human realities using animals is the key factor any student of writing might find fascinating and useful in this book.Animal Farm allegorizes many cultural stereotypes and not just political systems. A novella in size, Animal Farmmade George Orwell popular. George Orwell had written books such as Burmese Days (1934), Down and Out in Paris and London (1933), The Road to Wigen Pier (1937) and Coming Up for Air, before Animal Farm. Orwell\'s life changed, as a writer, with the publication of Animal Farm. Another book that followed asserted his popularity. This book was titled Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949).Animal Farmends with the shattering of hopes and irredeemable desperation. The leaders of the revolution, drained of all the ideological zeal appear to be profit mongering megalomaniacs. They become ""too practical"", to use a terminology from popular culture. Animal Farmends with an apt scene that exemplifies this.""The creatures from outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.""This scene narrates a confusion. No confusion, however, can be felt as a reader. It\'s crystal clear that the leadership of the animals have compromised. They no longer resemble the folk that started it all through the Rebellion. Yes, a rebellion with a capital R.Three philosophical quantum moments mark the body of the Animal Farmwith transcendental wisdom. I am not sure if Orwell had any intention to tell a story that was oriented in higher consciousness and the awareness of the Source. These three philosophical quantum moments help us tune into an unforgettable wavelength of higher consciousness through the story of animals that play human roles. These three quantum moments appear as follows: 1. Rebellion 2. The seven commandments 3. Banquet with humans.The Rebellion with a capital R serves the distinct purpose of establishing the harmony with an awareness that comes to Major through a dream-experience. Remember that this book is nothing else but animals pretending to run a world of humans. Plus, it\'s an allegory. This means, once we succeed in seeing through the maze of meaning in Animal Farm these concepts and nuggets of awareness can be assimilated into our personal lives too. This, I believe is the great historical value of Animal Farm. One receives the visionary idea about a political system that is going nowhere, but to the doom of its inhabitants, and at the same time can see through the meaning, the essence of human spiritual experience. Animal Farm, in this regard, is a deeply spiritual book. The best example for this experience is the scene of Major giving the lecture to the animals in the barn about an ideal society. The society resembles Thomas Moore\'s Utopia and Carl Marx\'s socialist state. However, the spiritual side of the book tells us to look into this scene and see why all those inhabitants find Major\'s concept of ideal society inviting. A harmony is at play here.The animals of the farm find themselves aligned with Promised Land that until then only existed in Major’s head. In Animal Farm, this Promised Land seems to be within the territory of Manor Farm. Only they have to bring it into life through their active participation. By giving the animals an anthem, Major extols the role of imagining a society where all animals are equal. Major has clearly attained a glance at his higher consciousness. It is from there he receives the dream as well as the anthem song, which he himself affirms to be lost in the chaos of childhood memories. Major represents any individual deriving his or her knowledge from one’s conscience. And conscience, as Dr. Viktor E Frankl points out connects our physical self with higher self. The farm animals feel the resonance with their needs and the dreams shared by Major.The Seven Commandments are written on the wall of the barn where Major first spoke of the dream of a society sustained in equality. This happens after the Rebellion. The Rebellion is a decisive moment that acts like a bridge between a dream and its manifestation into reality. As a result, the excited animals of the farm rename the farm as Animal Farm and assemble under the seven commandments.First commandment reads: “Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.” Engraved in the first commandment is the commitment the animals make towards building their new society—destroying humans. At one point, the animals start addressing the way of life they dream for themselves as “animalism”. Battling humans is the central treatise of animalism.Gradually, these set of maxims undergo subtle changes. Although the rest of the farm animals notice the change, they are unable to place their finger on the problem. As the time passes, the seven commandments that served as the semiotic map in preserving the ideal society dreamed by Major, the boar, undergoes manipulation and abandonment. The pigs appear as the ruling class, with Napoleon, a boar as their head. The pinnacle of manipulation appears as the seventh commandment that originally read: “All animals are equal,” is transfigured into “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” This scene evidently portrays the death of a realm imagined and attempted by the animals. Animals in this book are not merely animals; they are allegorical figures. This brings the thematic significance of seven commandments and the equality concept closer to human experience. The idea of a grand social order based on justice and equality is pure energy waiting to burst through and manifest into physicality. The manipulation of the seven commandments is the intervention of self-centered thinking and corruption blemishing the original idea.Eventually, the banquet with humans transforms the pigs into human-like, at least in the eyes of the observing animals. This event shuts the doors and puts the seal on the ideal notion of a society where everyone is equal. None of the animals in the farm feel aligned with the new notion that humans are better and that animals should work with them in order to progress. Napoleon announces some staggering changes in the running of the farm as well. Here is the time to unveil the spiritual lesson engraved in George Orwell’s Animal Farm.The pure creative energy that originates from the Source of all Being appears through Major and his dream. However, in its application, the animals fail to access the levels of success they dreamed the project would bring. The result would have been different if the animals had remained truly aligned throughout with the Divine creative energy that creates thoughts and manifests itself through dreams. In other words, instead of letting the Diving creative energy taking control of them, the ruling class of the animal farm takes control of the destiny of the farm animals. Perhaps, the ideal society was just a dream. But one is not sure. Each moment, every one of us covets to take hold of our own ideal worlds. The truth is no one can have it until we let our higher self resonates with the Source energy, call it god, Krishna, or Allah. Only our complete resonance with that energy can let the creation happen with the dreams we had manifested into the physical reality.', ""A great book 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell.Got the book in just 2 days, and the packaging was good.

I can't put my finger on why Bennett was so different this time round, maybe it was the fact that we see him enter into dangerous territory with two women and he just doesn't handle it all that well.The biggest let down for me was the story itself, it was lacklustre and to be honest a wash-out compared to the last one. The plot was pretty weak and the killer was all too predictable this time round. The addition of Emily Parker to the case didn't add much to the actual plot with the killer and it lacked being genuine.

Give Mr Wilson a try."", ""I have come to The Chronolits with huge expectations: it's been hailed as a masterpiece of modern sci-fi, mentioned by Time magazine as the notable book of the year, and so on.And yet (or perhaps because of those expectations), the book has been a he anti-climax for me.There is nothing wrong with it as such: in fact both the science element in the science-fiction and the speculative element in the speculative fiction is developed brilliantly.The idea that time travel of sorts (i.e. sending objects from the future into the past) can be used to influence the events between the sending and the appearance of the object is an eminently original take on time travel and explores philosophical implications of knowledge about future inevitabilities.The world building, although subtle and without much exposition, is very skilfully and the mood of millennial gloom and millennial madness is brilliantly caught.So why am I giving this, clearly above-average book, only the average number of stars?Wilson has been praised for character development, and I think the main character is exactly where the problem for me lies with Chronoliths: it seems to me that the author aimed for an Everyman figure caught in the vortex of non-causal inevitability.This worked, but in addition to that, for some reason the main character and the narrator is rather inexplicably (or was I too thick to understand the subtleties) guilt ridden, miserable and depressingly depressive.He feels guilty for the failure of his marriage (even though it was his wife who left him and divorced for an event he had absolutely no responsibility for). He feels guilty for her daughter's illness ending in a hearing loss in one ear (even though it was caused by an infection that he wouldn't have been able to stop). He feels a failure when he's sacked from his job (even though it wasn't his fault at all).He 's also (subtly, but noticeably) very American, middle class and rather right-wing in all his fatherly impulses. Ouch. No, I didn't like Scott Warden  at all, and I felt the book was written as if I was supposed to like him. The subtle self pity didn't help either.I am probably a bit harsh and it should really be 3.5 stars, averaging from four for ideas, four for world building and one for the main character I just couldn't stand.

Perhaps I am being a little harsh and maybe I missed the point as, on reflection, the post-non-war recovery and the application of the tau-thingy stuff to star travel is a reaffirmation of the old ` it's an ill wind...blah...blah' adage.

The Fist of God is my first Forsyth book and boy am I impressed! Riveting is not the word! Storytelling is an art and Forsyth has hit this one out of the park.The plot flirts with a nice blend of facts and fiction in the Gulf War that engages the reader right from the beginning. In my opinion, the author has not altered the actual course of events thereby making it a tenable and solid plot. The British, the Americans, the Iraqis, the Kuwaitis, the Israelis and the Viennese form the meat of the storyline.Forsyth is one pedantic writer! The description of characters is meticulous and every reader can form imageries in their minds whilst relating to the character or the storyline. A certain SAS soldier named Mike Martin is very likeable and the textbook definition of a special forces commander. The very nature of his line of work will make anyone respect the amount of sacrifice and perseverance that a soldier has to make to defy the odds and achieve their objectives. The unsung heroes; we have the MARCOS here who live by the motto: The few, the fearless. And they are also anonymous, behind enemy lines, weakening the enemy and averting a crisis before the war has begun. Mike Martin did his bit for the country and you\'ll definitely like the character for his ability to think on the fly.The author, owing to his experience as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force for Her Majesty, has taken diligent efforts to painstakingly describe the military hardware; most notably air surveillance and fighter planes, missiles and the like and how the Allied Forces flexed their muscles to gather intelligence and counter Saddam\'s plans. I have to admit that Forsyth has been scrupulous in his approach while describing the military hardware and at times, I had to look up images of planes, missiles and other hardware on the internet (despite playing most war games on the computer). So, the verbose description can get a tad exasperating but don\'t let that distract you from the awesomeness that ensues; when you come to know how powerful these weapons actually are. The expansive description coupled with a long list of characters is fundamentally the reason this book is a wee above 600 pages. But never did I feel that the plot is being dragged; there were simultaneous activities throughout the Gulf theater and even in the background in other countries.I won\'t give away any spoilers but if there is an example of being shrewd, I believe Mossad fits the bill perfectly! Their way of doing ""business"" is so spine-chilling and so secretive that their modus-operandi is  bound to rattle you to the bone.To immerse myself into another \'dimension\', I\'d often play the original soundtracks of Blackhawk down, Modern Warfare 1 & 2 to add to the dramatic effect. Can\'t complain as I also wanted to filter unwanted cacophony and chaotic sound around me! Give it a try! 🔕😂All in all, a gem of a thriller and I cannot wait to read the rest of his works. Up next is The Day of The Jackal; his best work until now. If you are looking for a quintessential thriller, look no further! The Fist of God will leave you enthralled and gasping for more.Warning: Strong withdrawal symptoms possible. Better stack up on his other books or some nice thrillers to cope up! 😋', 'An account of gulf war fought between the allied forces and iraq over the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.suberbly told..Character depth is praise-worthy..Would recommend this book for someone who is interested in war genre as I feel very few authors can  be as impactful as Fredrick Forsyth w.r.t this genre..', 'It is doubly amazing to note that the gulf war had occurred just for FF  to exploitatively use it for his war story. The elaborate research and elegant style of presentation made this book as a  Sui generis in its category. War strategies, human think tanks and persisting will to win are really wondering. For lay men the consumption is heavy as who normally will not think beyond soldiers, wars etc. Quite delicate, informative and thrilling.']";FIRST OF GOD, THE Penguin Random House9780552139908Fiction/Non-fictionLiterature & Fiction0552139904Literature & FictionABIS_BOOK  Read more

Little did he know that at a family masquerade, murder would be done...And so starts the wonderful third installment of Jane Austen mysteries, written in a remarkably similar prose to the late great author by writer Stephanie Barron.  She cleverly weaves real life events and characters from Austen's actual past into each of the stories (adding a lovely authenticity), and this is no exception, though the setting of a snow-blanketed Regency Bath at Christmastime does add to this story's atmosphere.The enigmatic Gentleman Rogue reappears again, as a main 'sleuth' this time, and together, he and Jane join forces to unravel the mystery of the murdered harlequin actor and the striking 'wandering eye' pendant left at the scene.It's a well-written, detailed, interesting and nicely paced story, one of the best of the series I've read so far, and I'd definitely recommend it for a good read, especially if you're a fan of Austen's work or indeed, Regency fiction in general.One word of warning - the author does have an irritating habit of inserting footnotes, where she explains references to people or places of the period used in the story (I'm guessing for her American audience).

It does not provide you with a description of the techniques of how to be a shaman, nor how to have an ecstatic journey, nor how to have an out of body experience, which is presumably what the one star reviewer was looking for.  Instead it provides a detailed description of shamanism as it was and is practised.There are over 50 pages of reference works on which Eliade drew in order to provide this summary, which groups his findings by region as well as by certain common practises - parallel myths symbols and rites.There are descriptions of the 'rebirth' experiences of shamans [the genuine near death experiences, not the common interpreation now used of born again]; the practises of healing, the travels of the shaman in out of body experiences, their roles as  psychopomp and their practise of healing via 'soul retrieval'.  He also describes 'soul loss' and what it means to each group.The amount of carefully researched detail that is provided is astonishing, it is almost a life's work but carefully organised into this relatively compact volume.  It draws on the work of anthropologists and the better and more serious researchers of religions, as such it is also reliable in its findings.Personally I found this book to be a treasure house of information - but then I bought the book knowing what it contained and what I was going to use it for.To summarise - an invaluable scholarly work on shamanic practises throughout the world over the ages ."", 'This is a substantial work on Shamanism, most particularly in Central Asia and including specific nuances in tribes and variations of, also extending to other regions.Eliade\'s text remains the classic. Although written some years ago now, it is very thorough and well-referenced, gathering together much ethnographic material.My only issue with it is Eliade\'s bias / judgment of the use of entheogens which Eliade regards as a less ""pure"" form of Shamanism amongst ancient tribes, than the use of pure sensory deprivation, sweat houses and drumming and dancing as a means of achieving the ecstatic state. To this end, Vitebsky\'s text is a useful balance.Highly recommended for any scholar researching shamanism.', 'This is probably the most comprehensive amalgamation of shamanism there is. This is a vast and broad subject that has been tackled very well and is a great piece of scholarship.Anyone who has even a passing interest in what shamanism is all about should really read this piece of work. Needless to say there are many books out there that possess the the concept of shamanism in the title but they generally tend to err towards a ideological meaning and skirt around the real content of what shamanism is essentially about.A great piece of work for people interested in society, psychology, religions origins and anthropology.

It\'s a book that takes the reader into the world of London publishing and celebrity ""A Lists"" and the latest low-down gossip that is being spread across tabloids, bars, and celebrity bedrooms all over London and beyond.Grace Armiger is a publicist who works for a small London publishing house called Hatto and Hatto.  It sounds like a glamorous job, but it\'s far from it.  Hatto and Hatto has gotten a reputation of never having books that make it to the bestseller lists, so their authors are never the ones that are treated like royalty at any bookseller festival.  In other words, it\'s a company that is going nowhere, and Grace is struggling to keep afloat.  To sum it up, the morale at work is only going in one direction: down.Her latest protege, Henry Moon, has just written the book SUCKING STONES, all about his adventures with an aboriginal tribe, and she is quite anxious to get this book into the realms of the bestseller lists.  Unfortunately, no one seems very interested in the book, and she can\'t seem to sell it at any of the book festivals.  Even getting a book signing for Henry is like pulling teeth.In the meantime, in another part of the London publishing world, Belinda Black, the queen of newspaper smut, is on a tirade and is bent on landing the number one celebrity, Red Campion, as her latest interview conquest. The lengths this woman will go to get her man is hilarious and I couldn\'t stop laughing at all her antics.  Her adventures, believe it or not, and Grace\'s publishing career, collide during the course of this book, as they both become involved in the world of high-in-demand celebrities and fast paced living.I don\'t want to give away too much, but I highly enjoyed GOSSIP HOUND.  Although I found it difficult initially to get into the book, once I got used to Wendy Holden\'s writing style the rest of the book went fast.  This book is not for the faint of heart, but for the lover of chick lit and name-dropping and fun trashy antics among the rich and famous.  It\'s fast paced and often times highly unrealistic. It also has a little romance tucked away, for those of you who like that sort of thing.  Read GOSSIP HOUND.

After a divorce, a history of being a kleptomaniac in the neighbourhood and not having attended college, Barnaby is confident that he will meet his angel as soon as he hits 30 and his life would certainly change. He meets Sophia at a station and decides that she was his angel who'd change his life but things continue to remain the same. His daughter is no more excited of their monthly meet ups, his mother keeps reminding him of the 8700$ he owes her and his childhood friend Len is always on about the sad, old car he drives.

The commentary on old age: its ugliness and sadness was touching and quite revealing. I don't think getting old is fun and a time of relaxation as youngsters imagine it to be. Anne Tyler has shown how heartbreaking and lonely it is to get old. She made me think that all you have collected in the decades of your life, they will all be left behind to get into the trash or in someone else's hands. At the end, nothing really remains yours.

The writing style and core concepts will be familiar to anyone who has read Fromm before now, also summarised well in the foreword:""Eric Fromm formulated in these essays what it means to be obedient to human nature and to the goal of a humane society, and to be disobedient to all sorts of idols and political ideologies. His reasoning is still relevant today. This disobedience to conformism and a critical stand against common ""non-sense"" should still be our main objective.""The contents are a mix of philosophy, politics and psychology, standard to fromm, and break down as follows;i. Disobedience as a psychological and moral problemii. The application of humanist psychoanalysis to Marx\'s theoryiii. Prophets and priestsiv. Humanism as a global philosophy of manv. Let man prevailvi. Humanist Socialismvii. The psychological aspects of the guaranteed incomeviii. The case for unilateral disarmamentix. The psychological problems of agingx. On the theory and strategy of peaceThe chapters in this book which may threaten to be more dull, such as the application of humanist psycho-analysis to Marx\'s theory dont prove to be so. While it is an essay from a different era, it characterises Fromm\'s unique concern to popularise and clarify Marx as Fromm understood him and gives a real insight into Fromm\'s thinking. It is also a pretty clear exposition of marxist humanism.The essay on Humanist Socialism is a pretty interesting conceptualisation of some of the core values of socialism which have not been well conceptualised since. While the essay on guaranteed income, which is briefly mentioned in both\xa0\nTo Have or to be?\n\xa0and\xa0\nThe Sane Society (Routledge Classics)\n, is an excellent exposition of a marginal economic and political idea, more recently favoured not simply by left wing radicals but also free marketeers and libertarians, see\xa0\nAgainst the Flow\n\xa0and\xa0\nIn Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State\n.This will particularly appeal to fans of Fromm\'s To Have or To Be? Since it is such a mix of proposals for structural and character change with Fromm\'s psychological, philosophical and quasi-theological precepts.I would also recommend it to any fans of Bertrand Russell, particularly his pacifist books, or Albert Schweitzer, whose books promoting a reverence for life closely mirror Fromm\'s concerns and philosophy. On the other hand I would hope that anyone could read Fromm and enjoy his writing as much as I have, his books brim with hope and optimism.Students beware, a possible criticism of this book is the omission of an index.', ""Dont be deceived by the title of this book! It starts out with a few interesting points but quickly spirals away from 'disobedience' and the capacity to doubt and criticise into a deluge of pro-socialism propaganda."", 'Fromm as always challenging our thought, with clear easy to read and accessible writing.']";“Human history began with an act of disobedience, and it is not unlikely that it will be terminated by an act of obedience.”—from On DisobedienceIn On Disobedience, Erich Fromm writes that the authoritarian dictatorships of the 20th century produced an “organization man” to follow directives blindly, no matter how abhorrent. At the same time, a kind of conformity has arisen in western democracies, only brought about by more subtle means of massive consumerism. In democracies, where the power to implement irreversible destruction rests in the hands of the few, the individual also needs to retain his ability to dissent and to speak

The chemistry between the man and woman is absolutely stunning. ""----Gilles MariniCarolina De Robertis, an Uruguayan author, pens a heart-touching and extremely poignant historical fiction in her new book, The Gods of Tango that unfolds the story of a young Italian woman who after finding out that her newly wed husband is dead, she decides to play tango music by dressing up as a man among the world of men in Argentina, but that leads her to a lot of unseen troubles where her sexuality and her sexual desires confuse her.Synopsis:Arriving in Buenos Aires in 1913, with only a suitcase and her father’s cherished violin to her name, seventeen-year-old Leda is shocked to find that the husband she has travelled across an ocean to reach is dead. Unable to return home, alone, and on the brink of destitution, she finds herself seduced by the tango, the dance that underscores every aspect of life in her new city. Knowing that she can never play in public as a woman, Leda disguises herself as a young man to join a troupe of musicians. In the illicit, scandalous world of brothels and cabarets, the line between Leda and her disguise begins to blur, and forbidden longings that she has long kept suppressed are realized for the first time. Powerfully sensual, The Gods of Tango is an erotically charged story of music, passion, and the quest for an authentic life against the odds.17-year old Leda has married her cousin, Dante by stand-in, who lives and works in Buenos Aires. After the wedding, Leda travels from her rural hometown in Italy to reach her husband in Argentina, only to find out that he has been shot dead in a workers\' protest rally and that she has become a widow. There is no option to return back to her dreadful life back in Italy thus Leda decides to disguise herself as a man with the help of Dante\'s clothes o play Tango music with her father\'s violin that he sent with her as a gift for Dante. Thus Leda, a.k.a., Dante embarks on a path that is not traveled by women in Argentina at a time when women wither served the indoor household works or served as a prostitute outdoors. Leda also joins a group of musicians who earn their name and reputation by playing tango music in various cabarets and hotels. But Leda/Dante often confused her inner desires and her self-identity when she was asked to accompany other men to the brothels. Can she survive herself as a he and with a he\'s desires?Firstly, I must comment on the book\'s scintillating cover image which aptly captures the flavor and the portrait of Tango as in dance form strikingly which instantly allured my mind and arrested me to open the book and read it. The story from the very first page, captivated my mind and my soul and kept me engaged till the very end, although, at times, I felt bit bored with the same kind of events occurring more than once or with too much details about tango and its importance rather than depicting the hardships of a woman during the early 20th century in Argentina, in depth.The author\'s writing is extremely aesthetic that will immediately grasp the literary fiction aficionados minds, that is laced with proper emotions that too holds the power to move the readers deeply. The narrative is not only inspired from and depicts the local dialect of Argentina but also vividly syncs with the musical notes of tango that will instantly fill the readers\' minds with this exotic and foot tapping music. In short, the dialogues are free flowing and extremely riveting enough to keep the readers glued. Now the pacing is very much slow, and it seems the story progresses at a snail\'s pace with lots of unimportant descriptions and detailings without which the story could also have been easily comprehended by the readers.The characters from this book are very much well developed and are painted with enough realism, especially the characters are very much layered with their flaws, cultural differences, gender differences and with empathy. The central character, Leda, is a very much honest character whose authentic and determined demeanor takes her to new heights and new places and the readers will experience those through her minds\' eyes and her deep thoughts. Leda cannot be an epitome but she can stand out as a diamond in the rough as she camouflages herself as a man in a world where women are treated with zero respect, and her journey through this risky world is not only intimidating but also encouraging enough to make the readers realize her struggles thereby rooting for her till the very end. The supporting characters are also very well etched out and are portrayed them as interesting and true to their soul.The sex or rather say the physical intimacy plays an integral role in this story just like the tango. Leda in her man self as Dante goes through tons of love affairs with women and the sex scenes between Leda and those women are carefully and smartly depicted with enough passion and heat to give wet dreams to the readers, and not even for once the author made Leda vulnerable in the eyes of those women and that what really amazed me and left me astounded with the intensity and the confidence Leda played along with those women.The backdrop of this story is vividly portrayed through the canvas where the author brings alive the crowded streets of Buenos Aires alive with the lively chatter in the dark alleys or the stench of sex in the brothels or with the humdrum of daily chores in those shared houses where the immigrants lived or with the sensual or delightful music of tango flowed from those glittering and high class cabarets or with the history of then time or with the strikingly landscapes of a city. in short, the readers are in for a treat as they will be immediately transported to this exotic city through the eloquent and rhyming words of the author.In a nutshell, this is an intriguing story with a soul-touching story line about a woman surviving with music and love in a man\'s world.', ""I enjoyed this book and found the descriptions of Buenos Aries at the time fascinating. I have been to the city and visited La Boca so loved to read about its recent history.Leda/Dante was a very brave person to take on Argentinian society at the time and become 'male' she was way before her time. Her sexuality developed after some time dressing as a male, she was initially confused about her feelings and sexuality.The reader was kept wondering as to what might happen when she was discovered.

HFQ has descended into a month by month war diary, which, while fascinating in many ways, isn't by any measure thrilling. The strategic situation doesn't change very much in the entirety of this volume, despite the promise of better campaigning weather during the summer months it covers. In fact, more happens in the arctic winter months than in the advantegeous summer. A quantum leap in technology is promised, then delayed. Intriguers intrigue, sailors sail and soldiers sit around a lot. Some die.It's quite a well-written book in terms of language and imagery (hotter than hell's hinges being a particular favourite), with very few proof-reading slips, but the story and character development have evaporated somewhat. In some ways, that was OK for me because I read it over a weekend when I was full of cold and it didn't over-tax my brain; it's comfort reading, a bit... Downton Abbey or Midsomer Murders. But really, we are paying quite a lot for these books fresh off the press and as they stretch out into a longer series, the cost of staying with it adds up. I shall stay with the series because I've invested in it and I'm an eternal optimist but if you haven't started reading this series yet, you might want to consider finding ways to borrow the books or buying them at a reduced price.One more thing, and this is common to the series: having read it on Kindle, I was settling in for another day's reading at 84%, when, out of nowhere, the book ended. That's an ENORMOUS appendix (as the Bishop said to the Inquisitor).Come on, Mr Weber, feed our imagination!"", 'Hell\'s Foundations Quiver by David Weber is the eighth installment in the ""Safehold"" series in which the major character is Nimue Alban who appears as various people, most often Merlin Athrawes.Some people love this series and others hate it. If you read this author mainly for his high-tech space battles, such as those in the Honor Harrington universe which kicks off with ""\nOn Basilisk Station (Honorverse)\n"" you should probably leave the ""Safehold"" series alone.Here is a possible test for whether you will like the ""Safehold"" series. If you play computer games or board games, the likelihood that you will enjoy this series is directly proportional to the pleasure you get from playing any of the versions of Sid Meier\'s Civilisation (link:\xa0\nCivilization VI (PC CD)\n) or similar games. The heroine of this series is doing what the successful Civ player has to do: shepherd a nation surrounded by enemies one step at a time from a pre-industrial era with muscle-powered weapons and units such as swordsmen and galleys through increasingly advanced periods of history and up to the space age while balancing the competing demands of defence against hostile powers, economic development, and scientific research, and simultaneously juggling politics, culture and religion.Most of the books in this series are massive doorstops and this one is no exception. After four pages of maps at the front, he hardback edition runs to page 579, and then there are a further hundred and five pages of appendices such as an index of characters, Glossary, and tables. You  will find the story suddenly coming to the end when there was still more than half a centimetre of pages to go in the hardback, or the progress bar at the bottom of the page on the kindle reaches about 85%.This series is aimed at the kind of reader who is interested in the results of a job of really large scale and thorough world-building.At the start of this novel the war between the Empire of Charis and the evil ""Church of God Awaiting"" has been going on for seven books with the good guys very gradually moving forward but, without wanting to spoil things, in this volume there is significant forward progress.If you\'re going to read this series, don\'t begin with this book: start at the beginning and work through in order. The nine ""Nimue Alban""/Safehold books published to date are:1)\xa0\nOff Armageddon Reef\n2)\xa0\nBy Schism Rent Asunder\n3)\xa0\nBy Heresies Distressed\n4)\xa0\nA Mighty Fortress (Safehold 4)\n5)\xa0\nHow Firm a Foundation (Safehold)\n6)\xa0\nMidst Toil and Tribulation (Safehold)\n7)\xa0\nLike A Mighty Army (Safehold)\n8) This book, Hell\'s Foundations Quiver9)\xa0\nAt the Sign of Triumph (Safehold)\nNot all the ideas are new: the story is a re-working of concepts from Weber\'s earlier books, particularly the Dahak trilogy ""Mutineer\'s Moon,"" ""The Armageddon Inheritance"" and ""Heirs Of Empire."" (That trilogy has also been published in one book as ""\nEmpire from the Ashes\n\xa0"".) But IMHO Weber uses the experience he has gained in the meantime to re-use the same basic ideas more effectively and with some original twists.For example, the Gbaba alien attackers who are at war against humanity at the start of the first book, and the threat of whom hangs over subsequent books, will remind many Weber fans of the Kangas from ""The Apocalypse Troll"" and even more of the Achuultani from the ""Dahak/Empire from the Ashes"" trilogy.The anti-technological church which the heroes and heroines are struggling against throughout the first nine books bears a striking resemblance to the church on Pardal in ""Heirs of Empire,"" the third book in the Dahak trilogy. But in both cases the presentation of those ideas is better done.None of the statements in this review are spoilers for ""Hell\'s Foundations Quiver"" but the following comments about the setting of this ninth book may infer more than you want to know about the outcomes of the seven previous books if you have not read them yet. If that is the case I suggest you navigate to the page for ""Off Armageddon Reef"" or the first book you have not yet read (see links above) without reading further here.The basic idea for the series begins in the 25th century, when humanity finds evidence that other intelligent races have recently existed on nearby stars but that a xenophobic alien race is exterminating them. The Terran Federation has just enough warning to make a fight of it when that enemy, the Gbaba, finds us and attacks ten years later. The war lasts fifty years - but towards the end of that time it is obvious that humanity is losing.Operation Ark, a final desperate attempt to plant a colony thousands of light years away from the area patrolled by the enemy, is launched. If they succeed, the colonists will face a choice: try to build a civilisation powerful enough to defeat the Gbaba, or abandon any technology which might attract their attentions and simply hide.The anti-technological faction in the leadership of the new colony win, and set up on the planet ""Safehold"" a totalitarian theocracy whose main aim is to stifle any technical change. For eight hundred years nobody on the planet knew that it was a colony, that humanity has a deadly enemy out among the stars, or that the real reason for the ban on technology was not God\'s command but to avoid attracting the attention of that enemy.However, eight hundred years after the founding of Safehold, a cyborg was activated with the mind and memories of Lieutenant-Commander Nimue Alban, a brilliant tactician who had been one of the thousands of people who gave their lives that the colony fleet could get through. When the corrupt leaders of the church attempted to destroy the nation of Charis for being too innovative, Nimue adopted the persona of ""Merlin Athrawes,"" a warrior mystic, and helped them to defeat the initial church invasion.At the start of the fifth book, through a mixture of war and brilliant diplomacy, Cayleb, the young King of Charis, had with Merlin\'s assistance created and consolidated an empire comprising most of the maritime island nations in the part of Safehold around his original kingdom. As Charis controls the islands and the seas, while the corrupt leaders of the Temple dominate the main landmass, we appeared to have the same sort of stalemate as when the Royal Navy of Nelson\'s time dominated the seas while Napoleon\'s Army dominated the land.But then during the fifth book the villain of the series, Grand Inquisitor Clyntahn, attempted to overthrow the government of the Republic of Siddarmark on the main landmass. Beset by ""Temple Loyalist"" rebels and facing huge invading forces of the Temple\'s so-called ""Army of God"" the position of those loyal to the Republic of Siddarmark looks desperate. But if Charis can help them hold on, a foothold for the good guys in Siddarhark will provide them  with an invasion route to the Temple itself.The sixth and seventh book described the first couple of year\'s desperate campaigning in the massive land war which follows. But by the start of ""Hell\'s Foundations Quiver""  loyal Siddarmark forces and their allies from Charis have held off the ""Army of God"" and then very slowly and painfully pushed them back. Both sides have raced ahead in technological terms - an extreme irony on the Church side as Weber is not slow to point out, since their war aim was to prevent technological change. In six years the Empire of Charis has moved from galleys to steam ironclads and is working on a class equivalent to late pre-dreadnaught battleships and have armed forces roughly equivalent to those of the more advanced powers on earth at the time of the late 19th century, while the armies of the Church are not far behind close enough to make pushing them back dreadfully expensive.There is also a fair amount of intrigue going on in this book, and Nimue discovers another group of people who have information left over from the founding of Safehold.One of the things that David Weber is good at is describing events, both diplomatic confrontations and wars, from the perspective of various viewpoint characters on different sides. In this series there is a particular added element to this - the ""Good Guys"" don\'t just need to win the war, they also need to start people on the other side THINKING for themselves so that the people of Safehold may become ready to learn the truth about the massive lies they have been sold, the real history of the planet, and the true enemy of every human which is waiting out beyond the stars.Previous stories have had sub-plots showing various people on the wrong side start to think for themselves - sometimes paying a very heavy price for it. Some of those characters had to change sides, some began to walk a tightrope between what they think is right and bringing the wrath of the Inquisition down on themselves and their families.Let\'s just say that there are more similar plotlines of a similar kind in ""Hell\'s foundations quiver.""In the last two books of the story arc, ""Hell\'s foundations quiver"" and ""At the sign of Triumph"" Weber explores what happens to strong totalitarian regimes as they finally start to come apart, and one or two scenes in these final two books in the initial story arc are begging to be turned into a ""Hitler rant ""Downfall"" parody with Grand Inquisitor Clyntahn as Hitler in the bunker.If you are only interested in getting back to the space battles, you will have little interest in the entire story arc which finally concludes in the ninth volume of the series. If however you have any interest in land and sea warfare between the 16th and 19th centuries, and what happened when different military technologies clashed, you may find it fascinating.The author\'s depiction of how the pressure of war might spur two competing alliances to modernise their economies, war production, weaponry and tactics has been covered in enormous detail. Personally I found most of this detail interesting, but had to skim through a few passages where the detail didn\'t do anything for me or appear central to the plot. There will be more than a few readers who find that all this detail makes the story far too slow.Nevertheless I think most of those who have enjoyed the previous books in this series will enjoy this one.', ""Other reviewers have pointed out that in the book's 784 pages, 105 are glossary of names and 16 are preface,  title pages and maps. They are little different (slightly expanded) from those in the previous 7 volumes (this is 8th in the 'Safehold' series).The series then is:1. Off Armageddon Reef2. By Schism Rent Assunder3. By Heresies Distressed4. A Mighty Fortress5. How Firm a Foundation6. Midst Toil and Tribulation7. Light a mighty ArmyIt is true, only the person who likes a modern epic novel's wide breadth of characters, detailed multi-stranded narative and can grasp the huge sprawling geography will get the most from this. I like this scale and the chopping from one plot line to another keeps you hungry from each one's next developments. Buit it is light reading only for those who work at it! Weber takes it close to its manageable limit here; and will lose some fans who can't follow quite so far perhaps.So what distinguished the 8th volume from its prequels? A question I do understand why other reviewers have asked. There is a degree of detail that must be repetitive as the huge World War front is followed for so long, in so may fronts, doing essentially alot of similar work. There is though, a real satisfaction here for anyone who has been gripped and needs the next instalment; who likes the building and development of all the details and underlying factors. The empire building tech-tree 4X game players are well served by this series and this book. Lighter weight sci-fi readers will find Weber's 'Honorverse' and Louis McMaster Bujold's 'Vor-saga' better bets in this genre (or Elizabeth Moon's Vatta/ Serano series for lighter still).So what will the next and 9th book do: Harchong's million+ army in a clash of titans, fractures and loss of faith in Zion precipitating true crisis internal to the Church? More Seijin interventions? Big Naval battle for a final resolution at sea? I hope more than just that: We need a bigger step and I have to wonder what plot device will enable Weber to maintain his grip on my attention. The cliff hanger (no spoilers) at the end of this book is not enough. Will it be more dramatic (potentiallly series ending)? The hints at a millenium 'archangel' revivial make me guess that Weber sees room for several more books yet.... he's going to have to look for new ideas to keep me going as far as 4 stars.""]";"Hell's Foundations Quiver: David Weber's New York Times-bestselling Safehold series begun with Off Armageddon Reef, By Schism Rent Asunder, By Heresies Distressed, A Mighty Fortress and Like a Mighty Army.TURNING OF THE TIDECenturies ago, the human race fought its first great war against an alien race-and lost.

Values, when attained, one could cherish the value of existence.✨Read on to know more about this amazing book and about why I think you should most definitely give it a try!Now, this article is divided into six categories.• Ratings and stuff about the book.• How I got my hands on this book.• Some background of the author.• The synopsis of the book.• About the writing style.• Some intriguing facts about the book.•Ratings and stuff about the book:Rating:\xa0Botopsy rating: 4/5✨Goodreads: 4.2/5Amazon: 4.5/5Length of the book: 360 pages long.Genre:  Fiction/Historical.Publisher:\xa0Picador India.Series:\xa0Standalone.Format:\xa0Paperback.•How I came across this book:As I've told before, I always try to read anything that is near to Hinduism. It binds me entirely. So this is the reason I picked up this book. I did my research and found out that it is the story of one of THE greatest epics: The Mahabharata, but the I've act that most intrigued me in buying this book is that the story is narrated in Panchali's version!Well, now I'm most satisfied with buying this book as it holds the knowledge and lessons of life about virtue and vice and the consequences of desire from the great epic.•About the author:Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni (born July 29, 1956) is an Indian-American author, poet, and the Betty and Gene McDavid Professor of Writing at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program.Her short story collection, Arranged Marriage won an American Book Award in 1996, and two of her novels (The Mistress of Spices and Sister of My Heart), as well as a short story The Word Love, were adapted into films. This book, The Palace of Illusions has been optioned to be made into movies or TV serials.Divakaruni's works are largely set in India and the United State, and often focus on the experiences of South Asian immigrants. She writes for children as well as adults and has published novels in multiple genres, including realistic fiction, historical fiction, magical realism, myth and fantasy.•Synopsis:This is not my first novel in this genre. I've read many books of this genre but, there is something in this book that makes it stand apart from the other books of the same genre. I think it is because the book is a rephrased form of the epic Mahabharata or it could be because of the writing style of the author or simply because it is in the point of view of a woman stuck in the middle of men's world.Told in the first person, Divakaruni's tale takes us through the epic in Panchali's voice. Panchali traverses us through various stages of her life. By her simple narration, we understand that she's not a normal girl of her time who nods along everything elders say, instead, she is the inquisitive type. Not only inquisitive type but also resilient and courageous type. Her nature was to rebel against the boundaries society has prescribed for women.The main plot revolves around the prophecy made about her that she will change the course of history. Having known the prophecy and being grown up alone in quarters in the palace that is restricted from outsiders and for her to step out, she was always sceptical of how would anyone this quarantined will change the history. Her only companions during childhood are her beloved brother, Krishna- her friend.By a twist of fate, she ends up married to five brothers at the same time. This changes her life completely. She inspires us by not getting defeated by her fate. She comes at peace with the facts and helps her husbands build a kingdom. However, no one is perfect, she commits some serious faults as a result of which she had her home, freedom and honour gambled away, almost stripped in public sowing the seeds of vengeance deep into her, her terrible life of hiding, servitude, evading assault and finally, the grim justice of war that killed many people both innocent and guilty and lastly having lonely death.While the above sequence of the story is the correct representation of the epic Mahabharata, the author, added a twist of her own to this book: Which man does Draupadi really love? How does she get to describe the battle? And the most resplendent discovery of all: who is the one who really, truly loves her?I can't bear to spoil the charm of these insights. Please read this poignantly told book for yourself.•The writing style:I found the author's portrayal of all the characters and illustration of scenes is extraordinary. She made me crawl into their skin, breathing and walking as I were they. Laughing and weeping for them, with them. Ultimately, I was inundated in the book entirely.•Intriguing facts:1. When the author decided to write this book, her friends and family and even strangers advised her against it, saying it was too difficult and she'd mess up with the sacred text.2. The biggest challenge was creating Draupadi’s character that had to be authentic yet timeless and surprising and very human too.3. Panchali was the most sought after beauty, but even she couldn’t live up to the ‘standards’."", ""Since childhood we grown up listening to Epic Mahabharata. And it portrayed in a way that women lead to destruction of thousands of people. The author narrated the whole story from the perspective of draupadi. It is tough retelling the mythology without ruining the actual one and author did it well. Some characters well written and i mostly admire Karna's character here. It blend a half myth and half history. Definitely a good read"", ""“A woman is not a touch but a response to it”----Pratibha RayChitra Banerjee Divakaruni, an Indian best selling novelist, has penned an extremely emotional and gripping mythological-cum-historical-fiction novel, The Palace of Illusions that narrates the great epic Indian mythological tale, Mahabharata from the point of view of the most brilliant and fearless female character, Draupadi, who weaves her thoroughly soul touching yet enduring life story starting from the day she was born to the day she left her palace and kingdom to follow behind the footsteps of her husbands to heaven. Yes, in modern terms, you call it a fan fiction of Mahabharata.Synopsis:A reimagining of the world-famous Indian epic, the Mahabharat—told from the point of view of an amazing woman.Relevant to today’s war-torn world, The Palace of Illusions takes us back to a time that is half history, half myth, and wholly magical. Narrated by Panchaali, the wife of the legendary Pandavas brothers in the Mahabharat, the novel gives us a new interpretation of this ancient tale.The novel traces the princess Panchaali's life, beginning with her birth in fire and following her spirited balancing act as a woman with five husbands who have been cheated out of their father’s kingdom. Panchaali is swept into their quest to reclaim their birthright, remaining at their side through years of exile and a terrible civil war involving all the important kings of India. Meanwhile, we never lose sight of her strategic duels with her mother-in-law, her complicated friendship with the enigmatic Krishna, or her secret attraction to the mysterious man who is her husbands' most dangerous enemy. Panchaali is a fiery female redefining for us a world of warriors, gods, and the ever-manipulating hands of fate.Panchaali, daughter of king Draupad, was born out of fire, when her father prayed and fasted for a son who will take vengeance on his enemies. So apart from Panchaali, a dark beauty and highly intelligent and smart young girl, Dhrishtadyumna, a fierce young boy was also born out of the very same fire. While growing up, Draupadi confided in only three people who were closest to her heart, her caretaker, Dhai Ma, her brother, Dhri, and her only friend, Krishna, who guided her through all her troubles with his wise and thoughtful advice. But when the time arrived for Swayamvar, Draupadi's heart has already found the man of her life, but due to her father and Krishna's strategy and scheme to protect the king and the kingdom from his enemies, thereby yet once again Draupadi followed what others wanted her to follow before her heart's desire. Once landing into the palace of her husband, Arjun, Draupadi, once again, had to fight for and obey the rules and the opinions of her mother-in-law, Kunti, who asked her to marry off five of her sons, instead of only one. From then on, Draupadi had to lead a sad and enduring life filled with only grief, pain and loss and embarrassment. But not for once Draupadi spoke out aloud of her grief either to her husbands or to her own family, instead she quietly obeyed and payed heavily for everything that her husbands did.This is one of the most enthralling and magical re-telling of the epic mythological tale that changed the history, spiritualism, thoughts and beliefs of Indian society. The whole tale felt like an astounding, mystical and breath taking read that blew my mind with the intensity of Draupadi's heart breaking life story as well as with the opportunity to lose myself in the thrill of the greatest mythology, Mahabharata told from the perspective of a brave woman. The author has not only imagined and projected her version of this epic tale, but has also included the wise words of Vyasa, the original author of Mahabharata.The author's writing style is exquisite and eloquent and has laced the story line with so many deep, heart felt emotions that will move the readers for the characters' plight. The narrative is somewhat intellectual, thoughtful and truly authentic and it is told from the first person point of view of Draupadi, so that will let the readers contemplate with her honest voice. The pacing of the book is very slow and while reading, the readers might feel a bit lethargic due to the usage of heavy words and too many philosophical adverbs by the author.The characterization of the protagonist, Draupadi, is really well carved out with all her flaws and her stronger aspects, with her desires and her hatred and with her positive and negative thoughts, thereby letting the readers experience and get to know Draupadi in her raw form. Draupadi has been brilliantly portrayed into the story and has been brought alive with so much vigor by the author. The readers will be shocked to go through the intense pain of Draupadi's struggle with her childhood days, her marital life, her role as a pawn in the game of the greatest war in the history of our country, her emotions towards how the brothers fought against his own blood just for the price of kingdom. In short, the rest of the supporting characters, do not much role or depth in them, either way, from Draupadi's minds the readers can chalk out a brief sketch of those characters.In a nutshell, this is an excellently well written fan fiction based on Hindu mythology that will enlighten the readers' minds and souls as well as keep them entertained all through out the book.""]";‘An epic story ... poignantly told’ Hindustan Times ‘Radiant ...

Whilst the feat of holding a world record for Channel swimming is remarkable in itself, it’s not really about that. It’s just a story about how a very ordinary boy was coached to do something extraordinary by somebody who believed that kids could do extraordinary things if encouraged. This is as much about Tom’s coach, John Bullet, and his achievements, as about Tom’s own.And it’s a lament to the loss, over 30+ years since, of our ability as a society to tolerate risk to kids, to watch them go through effort, pain and suffering to see them grow and become something more than they otherwise would have. We talk to kids about courage, confidence and resilience, but this story shows one amazing example of how you can really build that.The book succeeds because of the author’s impressive recall of the detail of events, especially the thoughts inside his own head. That makes the book a great read as well as a great story, with a message.Highly recommended.', 'I didn’t expect to particularly like this book, but it was our Book Club choice. I am very grateful. Full of gentle humour, it is a story told with searing honesty and love. My admiration knows no bounds both for the small boy with such courage and determination and to folk like John Bullet who give themselves to their community and enrich it. I sobbed at the end and felt very sad that the world has become so cynical that anyone with a John’s drive today would be expected to have some dark ulterior motives, pilloried on social media and possibly prevented from developing such character and fortitude, much needed in our ‘snowflake’ society.', 'I became aware of Tom Gregory many years before I had any interest in marathon swimming. He was, and ever will be, the youngest person to swim the Channel (F-E ’88) – a little short of 12 in both age and hours!Assumed, correctly, that life had led him in other directions, so it was with delight I caught a reading on BBC radio of a book authored by Tom.What I hoped for was a blow by blow account of the swim and the training, and it certainly delivers that. The human interest angle though was a real revelation. Set to a backdrop of popular music from my own youth, and the swim haunts of my recent years, surely made it easier to relate to personally; the real crux of this tale though is the relationship between Tom and his mentor, John Bullet.In answering the question of how an 11 year old achieved such goals, the narrative evolves into a commentary on his relationship with John, and effectively contrasts how much societal attitudes have changed over 30 years. The author is sympathetic to the perception that John’s methods would be considered inappropriate by modern standards, and doesn’t shy away from the darker moments, yet he presents a child well supported by his family and network of swimming friends, his sister in particular, and robustly advocates that, much as he wanted to impress John, he ultimately made his own decisions. For my part I agree.Tom gives an interview in the November issue of Outdoor Swimmer which discusses his surprise at some of the reactions to the book, and further defends his original position.Really interesting read.']";**Winner of the William Hill 2018 Sports Book of the Year Award**A Sunday Times Book of the Year and Telegraph Best Book of 2018'Extraordinary' Clare BaldingThe poignant, life-affirming story of a determined boy, a visionary coach, and how the dream of a record-breaking Channel swim became realityEltham, South London. 1984: the hot fug of the swimming pool and the slow splashing of a boy learning to swim but not yet wanting to take his foot off the bottom.

This quote could apply to this book.There is a mafia style French family, that Cornwell introduced in book 10 in the series.

The three books would have been so much better, with a whole lot more editing.The other thing is, Cornwell has a tendency to write out major characters, or potential major characters.

Ringer has written, and found great value in them all. His latest book, ""Getting What You Want,"" is no exception. Ringer, who was influenced by the writings and philosophy of Ayn Rand, expounds again on Rand/Ringer principles for living: being grounded in reality, giving value for value in business and personal relationships, adhering to a code of honesty, ethics, and self-discipline. To this he adds his own Ringer philosophy of avoiding people, encumbrances and causes that drain your time and energy without contributing to your major goals. These are themes he has explored before, in ""Looking Out For Number One"" and ""Million Dollar Habits""; but they are worth reading again, especially when reinforced by some new examples and perspectives, e.g., Ringer\'s experiences with his new employees in New Zealand. Some new issues that Ringer brings to ""Getting What You Want"" are getting rid of major encumbrances, in the form of a bad job, too much debt or an unhappy marriage, and how to move on with life following a bad break, such as the loss of a job or suffering an injustice.Ringer\'s writing is full of good advice on how to succeed in life, but it is not only the advice that keeps me buying his books. As a writer, he is just plain interesting. His expositions are invariably illustrated by his own personal foibles, missteps and screw-ups, which are sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and always effective. In this book, he tells how he allowed himself to be pushed into acting ""intimidating"" on the ""Tonight"" television show, even though it misrepresented the real message of his first book, and how he wasted time in a trivial lawsuit until he realized that it was more about his injured pride than about money. Ringer also discusses three personal friends who suffered terrible personal setbacks (one was confined to a wheelchair following a traffic accident), but who were determined to succeed in spite of it, and did. Ringer\'s point: life is full of injustice, and the best thing to do is to learn from it what you can, and move on.In ""Getting What You Want,"" Ringer brings back his alter-ego, the tortoise, a comically drawn character who often illustrates his books. I have always liked the tortoise metaphor and the message it brings, that the race is not always to the swift, that persistence and perseverance can often win the contest even though one is not the fastest runner afoot. Ringer himself personifies this, as he has no special higher degrees or training; he is the self-made man, the legendary ""little guy"" who succeeds against all odds and obstacles, including government bureaucrats, hostile attorneys and deals that go bad. Perhaps that is why so many of his readers, including this one, find him so compelling.Ringer ends this book with a delicious slice of philosophizing that I always enjoy from him. He has a fine mind, one that is open and willing to explore the cosmic ""what-ifs."" In the final chapter, ""Afterword: the Endgame"" Ringer discusses what happiness is, and some ways of achieving it. He touches on the concept of God, the existence of good and evil, and puts forth some interesting insights. Finally, he describes some examples of what mystics call ""the mystical experience,"" including his own, a sudden burst of cosmic insight that can inspire joy and a sense of heightened awareness. The titles of Ringer\'s books always sound as if they were focused on amassing material wealth. Take it from me, there is a lot more to Robert Ringer than that.', ""Robert Ringer is quirky in his book titles.  He could probably boot-lick more sales if he liberally applied drool.He, of course, doesn't, and I am convinced that the titles almost self-sort his buyers and readers---Yes, it really IS best if you're a thinker, to read Ringer.Real world philosophies, w/ a nudge to get off the sidelines!VERY satisfied buyer and reader.YOU will be, too.""]";The author of Winning Through Intimidation and Looking Out for #1 shares his insights into achieving success in every area of life--from business and financial security to romance--by advocating the importance of such principles as Lower Your People Taxes, Commit to the Truth, and Refuse Free-Lunch Temptations. 50,000 first printing.

Regardless of when they were written and Jarvis's books are of the modern era there is a certain class of children's book that transcends time and for me the 'Whitby Witches' is one of that canon and in a hundred years will probably be regarded as a classic. Superbly written, this is a darkly humerous tale with appropriate scary bits based around the North Yorkshire town of Whitby and the lives of two orphans who have ended up in the care of their Aunt Alice and the adventures they have around the town. This version of the book has some detailed information on Whitby and it's history and environs and also an interview with the author Robin Jarvis. If your child is a confident reader they should be able to manage this with little difficulty, however, as a caveat the book does have some dark descriptions and scary concepts that a younger child may need help and reassurance with.

As the streets darkened trembling in case I was chased by the Barghest or stumbled upon a coven of witches.This is no Disney tale, dark, scary and frightening at times but the home and safe place Alice Boston provides for Ben and Jennet at the centre of the story means I would be comfortable for my children to read the book from about the age of nine up.So happy Egmont are publishing a new edition of this book as part of their Modern Classics for Children Series.

It seems every time I read a Mary Higgins Clark book I think the same thing. I couldn't put it down!

They might not be the most challenging plots or thought provoking books, but they're excellent entertainment and this one was no exception.

I know that I'm getting excellent characterisation. And I also know that I'm going to get a very well developed plot and that I'll be surprised several times over before the end of the book.If I compare this latest book to Mary Higgins Clark's first I also feel that she's moved with the times and adapted her stories to modern life.

No, these women enjoy and understand nature, they studied biology, science has meaning for them, they live by their wits and they love men but they aren't dollies or money grabbing high-flyers. This book is  a breath of fresh air."", ""This novel captured all my heart. The book alternates between three stories whose links gradually emerge, set in a tiny community of 600 people where, every person is somehow linked to the few inhabitants of the area as well as intimately linked to the nature that surrounds them.First there is Deanna Wolfe, a 47-year-old biologist who lives in a log cabin payed to scour the National Forest land for poachers while keeping track of her beloved coyotes that settle nearby. The divorcee's two-year solitude is interrupted by Eddie Bondo, a sheep farmer 20 years her junior, who reconnects her with her physical needs for proximity and social companionship.Secondly there is Lusa Landowski, a city-born entomologist married to Cole Widener whose family makes it very hard for her to settle. The day personal tragedy strikes, she gradually finds a way to love the area, to find her own calling and grows closer to her five sisters-in-law and their children.Thirdly, there is the elderly Garnett Walker whose main purpose in life is to revive the American chestnut tree, made extinct by loggers and fungal blight, while warring with his neighbour, Nannie Rawley. Here again, the story evolves beautifully and the two neighbours grow to accept and help each other in ways they could not anticipate initially.The three main women protagonists have in common their fierce independence and strength of personality and the novel insists convincingly on the shared animality of humans, regardless of their efforts to subdue nature. The descriptions of the passing seasons, the fecundity of the earth and beauty of the surrounding woodlands is rendered so well that I was captured by every single page of this book.Highly recommended!"", 'I’ve become a huge fan of the author since reading a few of her books last year so am working my way through her back catalogue. I enjoyed Prodigal Summer though not as much as her other books. Love stories runs through the book and to be honest I didn’t enjoy these moments as much as the rest of the book. I could have done without the sex scenes between Deanna and her hunter. I’m not a prude but sex scenes in books irritate me more than not. I just want them to stop so I can get on with the rest of the story. I really enjoyed the way the lives of Deanna, Lusa and the feuding neighbours gradually interweave and you gradually find out the links between them with some connections bigger and more obvious than others. The characters are well written and really come to life. I also loved the sense of places created in the book and as ever the author’s beautiful prose.']";Barbara Kingsolver's fifth novel is a hymn to wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature itself. It weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives amid the mountains and farms of southern Appalachia. Over the course of one humid summer, this novel's intriguing protagonists face disparate predicaments but find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place.

The point is that she was able to get back in touch with something she had been denied: both the painting process and her feelings. The paintings are haunting gestures,  consistent with the verbal account of her process and lack of time. I feel blessed to have these images after having read 4 of her books and working through my own situation of being denied a creative future till mid-life and having difficult parents. Her book will have a place with my other art books."", 'Alice Miller\'s first book\xa0\nThe Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self, Third Edition\n\xa0had been recommended to me by a friend who strongly believed it had helped her and could help me as well.  Alice Miller believes (if I understand correctly) that childhood abuse is extensive and repressed and cannot be remembered reliably by the brain, but rather is perfectly remembered in the body (this is made more plain in\xa0\nThe Body Never Lies: The Lingering Effects of Hurtful Parenting\n).  These perfect memories in the body can be brought to the conscious mind through certain forms of therapy.  Miller believes that she was able to recall abuse from her own childhood through the creative use of watercolors.  On her website in the essay ""Depression: Compulsive Self-Deception,"" she wrote in relevant part about the revelatory process of painting ""it was my hand that did this, as it obviously knew the whole story and was only waiting until I was ready to feel with the little child I once was.""  How does a hand store memories and ""know the whole story""?  How does a hand gauge the readiness of the brain to process something and ""wait"" for that?Potentially, Pictures of a Childhood could have been her most useful book, serving as a workbook of sorts, since her other books don\'t (at least in the ones I\'ve read so far) indicate how one is supposed to recover childhood memories, or how one can trust them.  Regrettably, it contradicts the title in that it does not shed any light on her childhood abuse, nor on how readers might be able to recall abuse from their own childhoods.  She mentions in the short text ""Childhood and Creativity"" which precedes the sixty-six watercolors that her mother had toilet-trained her at an exceptionally young age, but that\'s about the only concrete example, and one that was related to her by her mother, not recalled through art.  What memories did she uncover using the watercolors, and exactly how did she recover memories using the watercolors?  She doesn\'t say.  In her preface she writes that she did not give titles to the watercolors she reproduced ""because I did not want to restrict my readers\' freedom of perception.  As they view these pictures, they should be able to play with their associations and, influenced by their own history and way of seeing things, make discoveries for themselves.""  Why should drawings that somehow depict the childhood abuse she endured resurrect memories for other people?  Are they actually impersonal, more like Rorschach blots or Thematic Apperception Tests?  She doesn\'t mention those, curiously.The text itself is short on footnotes: ten, only three of which are to works other than her own.  There are interesting statements that should have been footnoted but weren\'t, like ""it is not rare for colors to awaken petrified feelings.""  There\'s no bibliography.  There is an appendix, which appears as an afterword in many of current editions of her books.She describes to some extent how she does her watercolors, but not entirely.  Most of them have blotches of color over which black blotches and lines have been drawn.  The black lines tend to suggest human faces and figures, which suggests a more conscious effort than she describes in the text, though many of the drawings appear entirely abstract and nonrepresentational.  She also selected specific watercolors for the book, and chose to enlarge, reduce, or crop some of them.  She doesn\'t describe how or why she chose the ones she did or how she chose to present them.  Even if she had described the process of engaging with a single one of the drawings and recovering memories from it, the book would have been much more interesting.  Without that, it\'s pretty disappointing.A number of additional paintings by her can be found on her website.  They lack names and descriptions as well.  Some of them have faces and figures that are much more clearly defined.  If anyone is aware of a place where she has written in more detail about how her watercolors helped her, let me know!']";

Each universe plays out alternate realities to our own existence.  Well Greg bear's book is so plausible in that respect - in fact throw out the alternate reality - some of this stuff could happen to us in the not so distant future.I won't give this book 5* 'cos I do find the heist somewhat implausible and I found that bit tedious, and seeing what the Porn industry in the book is capable of doing does make this seem even more improbable but hey, this is a work of fiction.But it is in the little things which ring true and then you feel the shift beneath you as what you consider to be reality is pulled from under you.  They do say that the porn industry is at the forefront of all of these internet-type advances - how money is transacted, etc.  That the book was published in 1997 and so much of this is now coming to pass (in some form or other) is making this guy out to be some sort of visionary.  The notion that practically everyone's psychological disorders are now hidden away and what happens when they all start to resurface is frightening in itself.I sure hope that all of this doesn't quite turn like this scenario.Get it and read it - full of suprises."", 'Still relevant, well written and exciting to read.', 'This is an expertly imagined and entirely plausible tale about the impending dangers of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.  Years ago I read Ray Kurzweil\'s ""The Singularity is Near"" and have been looking for a sci-fi novel that fleshes out the ideas Kurzweil laid out.  ""Slant"" does an excellent job--and it was written 8 years before Singularity!  (Full disclosure here:  There is no mention of Singularity or the incomprehensible computing power of self-improving computers in Slant--just super powerful computers.)Yes there\'s sex.  Lots of it.  This turns a lot of people off.  But there are a few things to consider.  First, the sex is not gratuitous.  It\'s not porn even though one of the main characters is a porn star and there is a porn scene in chapter 2.  How can this be?  Well, it\'s sex but I can\'t quite call it titillating.  It\'s real but it doesn\'t celebrate porn.  In fact, with the emotional destitution described I\'d say the sex parts of Slant are an indictment of porn.  Second, Bear is honest in his approach to nanotech motivations especially towards sex.  Witness the current enthusiasm towards advanced holographic media like that seen in the Sochi Olympics.  Soon entire stadiums will watch judo competitors 200 ft tall grapple for dominance.  Every seat will be better than front row.  In your living room you will be able to watch a full sized wide receiver in 3D holographic run 60 yards for the touchdown.  You\'ll see it from any angle you want.  Now, what\'s the response in the comments section to these marvels?  ""Everybody is thinking how great the porn will be with this technology.""  Porn drove the early internet and it will drive early nanotech.  Bear understands this and is honest about it.But how will nanotech do that?  Subscribers ingest nanobots that hook into their somatosensory systems and nerves.  Porn stars to the same.  The porn star nanobots record and transmit the nerve impulses and subscribers pick them up.  So not only will you see and hear everything but FEEL everything too.  But gone and thoroughly absent are the emotional and spiritual aspects of sex.  This is the future folks and Bear is totally honest without being moralistic about the emotional havoc this creates.  But this novel is NOT entirely about sex.It is also about therapy.  Nanobots monitor a persons neural pathways.  Pathologies can be detected and more healthy pathways can be routed around the pathological ones.  Everyone can be healthy.  And most are.  If nanotech will give us access to every single neuron in our brains why wouldn\'t we use that ability to improve our mental health?  Well, we do.  And it has disastrous results!  Something goes wrong with the nanotech monitors and people start resorting back to their neurotic and psychotic tendencies.  In fact, new neuroses and mental health issues are introduced.  Since we\'re all tied into and now dependent on this nanotech for our mental health, our entire society is racing towards insanity and the brink of collapse.  Technology.  Ain\'t it great?And then there is Artificial Intelligence--AI.  Jill is a super computer working for the company that gave us these nano monitors.  She is hacked by a new AI--Roddy--and suffers basically a blue screen of death.  And there is Omphalos--the gold and white pyramid that is a warehouse for people who want to freeze their brains and wait out the coming collapse to emerge later and build a new society.  SPOILER ALERT!!!  They\'re connected to Roddy.The characters are very real and expertly drawn:Jack Giffey:  A Sam Elliot kinda guy.  Older, tough, grizzled.  He\'s on a mission throughout the entire novel to bring down Omphalos.  A good guy unless you cross him.  Then he can go Special Forces on you.Alice:  The porn star.  A tragic character.  You feel for her in her despair and loneliness.Jonathan:  I imagined him as Ethan Hawke.  Awesome character!  He adores his wife but she just can\'t stand him.  Her therapy has gone haywire and he has to parse the technological bugs from her true feelings.  You gotta really feel for the guy.  Another tragic character par excellence!Marcus:  Jonathan\'s new boss.  Head of Omphalos.  Utilitarian.  The ends justify the means.  But he doesn\'t come across as evil just elite and a bit arrogant.  In the end, he\'s constitutionally pretty weak--can\'t walk the walk.Jill:  The AI.  Great Pinocchio character!  She\'s a computer (doesn\'t want to become human) who wants to help her human creators and has gigantic obstacles thrown at her by Roddy.  Good tech talk and descent plotting of her plight without getting tied down to technology that can become obsolete.Mary Choy:  Good cop character.  Strangely, she spans two or three novels but she doesn\'t have a whole lot of development here save for one scene in which her own nanotech goes wrong and endangers her life as well as exposing her deepest vulnerabilities.  That scene is her best in the book and truly delivers.Overall the novel is a slightly noir cop/mystery/thriller book.  It really satisfies the itch I\'ve been trying to scratch with respect to finding a real novel that grapples with the impending nanotech/AI revolution.  This one does it in spades and truly makes you think.']";In the sixth decade of the 21st century, the world has been transformed.

We both are keen on anything regarding China, or Asian countries & thus Heaven Lake was her fast pick from a large monthly menu simply for the cover.  Here\'s why I was uncertain about it, & don\'t wish to offend anyone, but may in fact caution \'do not make any assumptions\' because it feels like the book may be themed\' Christianity takes on Communist China\', with the introduction of the main character, Vincent, as the sanctimonious ""Jesus man"" who arrives in Taiwan to try a soft sell by offering free English classes. Conversely, those interested in missionary work in Asia, may find the wild detour of adventure & mayhem that ensues, just that. Regardless, I think it\'s a marvelous story which I believe to be in most part non fiction, at least the knowledge & firsthand experience of the far reaches of China, that which lies between its immense vastness, climate & terrain changes, languages & people within, plus Taiwan, the Island in its wake. The writing moves at a steady pace, yet I took many pauses to admire, appreciate, & applaud - albeit reading alone, Dalton\'s insights which were not heavily laden but captured the essence of the moment. His characters were so well drawn, unencumbered by description, spoke for themselves, the dialogue a key component to keeping the story lively. There is so much given to the reader. A unique, original & intriguing story with many episodes of unpredictability that occur, one is never bored. A cast of characters whom evoke empathy, while others contempt. Excellent writing, that has been properly crafted, coaxed & edited, by a talented  & obviously hardworking author who has gone to painstaking lengths, in research, and accuracy, to produce an exciting, fascinating & thoroughly satisfying book.', 'As I often do, I chose this novel because I was intrigued by the cover and title. Props to the marketing people!  Once I opened the book, I began a journey that in many ways was nothing like my own, while at the same time feeling very familiar to mine. In that respect, it\'s safe to say the this novel is a paradox about life anticpated vs life experienced.Dalton\'s choice of a third person omniscient narrator allows the reader to see what\'s happening inside the mind of the main character, as well as feel the external joy and pain associated with his various encounters with people on his missionary journey as a ""Jesus teacher."" The setting of the entire novel is in/near China, and Dalton provides excellent details to help the reader feel the heat, cold, bustle, and barrenness of its multiple locales. The narrator\'s interaction with one of his high school students provides danger, as well as opportunity for personal growth. As a result, this young Jesus teacher experiences a crisis of faith that appears totally at odds with his chosen profession but is actually clearly aligned with where he is in his life. In other words, he experiences the conflict between what he has chosen to do and its variance from his real experiences.Along the way, he makes friendships that feel improbable at first but become understandable the longer he is in them. Some of these are with women with whom he has no realistic expectation of intimacy; some are with men with whom he has very little in common. In the end, he realizes that ""intimacy"" has more meanings than he\'d imagined and that ""in common"" isn\'t always as clear as we think. There was a powerful ending conversation with an elderly Chinese gentlemen that illustrates the universality of people\'s struggle to have faith when life often interferes.Dalton provides a sensitive, insightful, and often profound protrayal of humanity\'s struggle to understand how the experiences of life often take us somewhere that our grand plan hadn\'t anticipated or intended. His open ending allows reader to imagine what might happen next in the the protagonist\'s life.

Anyways  , written  below are my exact words from my first time reviewing  this book and I think the review was apt then and it is apt nowif you grew up reading a bunch of Batman, Detective Comics , Sherlock Holmes, Hardy Boys & Nancy drew and have a thing for the paranormal and Fantasy than you need to find the time to read this and thank Jim Butcher .Storm Front is the first of the mightly praised Dresden Files book written by Jim Butcher and it merges two of my favourite Genres Together\xa0Fantasy\xa0and\xa0Mystery\xa0and the book does the job very well . The book is fast paced and makes you feel as if you are watching a sort of movie . The book succeeds in keeping you on your toes and guessing what will happen next and makes you really excited all the time as wellHowever the book has a few shortcomings in itself one of my major gripes with the book was the ending which felt awfully premature . `[ how easily Dresden gets away from the law both human and magical without much of any explanation really turned me off . While the book succeeds with the key ingredient of any mystery novel i.e keeping you excited for the next page , it fails in another key of such mystery novel i.e keep you predicting the mystery end. Same thing goes with Fantasy to me a good fantasy is the fantasy which explains its world properly , Dresdne's world is very poorly explained & the Character development of Susan, Bob, Marcus was seriously lacking . There's another kinda thing that some could find critical is the fact that much of the book feels like Cliche. Personally that has never stopped me from enjoying the book and it didn't stop me this time either but to each his own i guessSo i must say this is a good read and for me inner nerd This Character is brilliant and i can't wait to read furthur\xa0"", 'Pretty cool book.

Some regard it as a competitive system, regulated through self-interest, sanction, and reward. Others believe trees care for one another, and act as guardians, sharing resources, with the healthy supporting the weak. A free market versus a socialist’s dream.“Everything the Light Touches follows four people who, separated by time and place, share a love for travel and ecology. Their connection transcends time and yet their common purpose adds weight to the knowledge that people, like plants, have to find their roots.The book has a lyrical prose with a philosophical bent that is explained using the language of botany. The characters\' individual journeys evoke a sense of purpose and belonging that is connected like a network of roots under the ground – invisible on the surface but a source of strength and nourishment.As much as I loved the writing, I confess I didn’t quite understand the purpose of the characters’ stories. For me, it made more sense as short stories where the reader revisits each character. Or maybe that’s how it was meant to be. And yet, there were moments when I was utterly captivated by the poetic nuances. It was like a picture being drawn before my eyes – word by word.One of those rare books that you enjoy not for the story but simply for the experience of reading.For complete review, visit aquamarineflavours.wordpress.com', 'The message that Janice puts forth in this book is important, specially in the times we live in. The idea of taking only what we need is something we really need to imbibe in ourselves and our lives. Another concept I loved was that of leaving something behind when you take something from the nature. The idea of conservation and the concept of ownership explored in the story really grips you. The story with the Rooster was something I have never heard and that is one that made me smile, especially the way it unfolded. Another one that stood out for me was that of when they talk about contracts and how keeping one’s word is considered sacred.The characters Janice brings to life in this book have a purpose and despite there being many, each of the character leaves their mark on your mind. So be it Shai in the contemporary times, or Evie in the Edwardian era, or Goethe and Carl before them, each of them charts their own path, and curiously the shift in the time is understood as the story is told and the years not expressly indicated.']";

A must read', 'I met the author of this book on Facebook a few months back, and he suggested this book to me. Since the publishers were Fingerprint, one of my favorite publishers, and the blurb planted seeds of intrigue in my mind immediately, I decided to give this book a go.After I finished reading the first chapter, which is a dream, I was confused. If the dream was from the girl’s POV, how could the feelings of the boy be shown (the excitement between the legs, etc.)? That seemed like an error. But even after that, throughout the story, the author does do head hopping quite frequently. I can understand that the author has used the ‘Third Person Omniscient’ technique, wherein the narrator is the all-knowing entity, but this narration technique is not recommended nowadays as it tends to involve head hopping (multiple POV’s in a single scene), which makes the read confusing as the reader gets to know the thoughts of all characters in a scene instead of just a single narrator. Also, there are too many long blocks of telling in the narrative instead of showing, which again violates the show-don’t-tell rule. It requires a lot of hard work to weave small blocks of telling into a scene, which the author didn’t do consistently. But of course, these minor technical glitches can be forgiven as he is just a debut author. With experience, he will improve.Although veiled by a sense of mystery, a good part of the story is an ordinary campus romance. The narration, though, is good enough to make you keep turning the pages. However, I didn’t like the way the boy, without even trying to be friends, directly proposes to the girl. It seemed too forced and unnatural. But once their friendship began, things settled down for good. Since I’m not quite good as far as prediction goes, almost all the plot twists were surprising to me. The language is very good; the sentences are quite poetic at places, and the overall editing is also tight, as expected from a Fingerprint book. However, it felt strange to spot a few spelling and punctuation errors here and there, a rarity in other Fingerprint books. At one place, ‘clam’ is written instead of ‘calm’, and I noticed a few punctuation errors, especially at the end of dialogues that are followed by an action. A period should be used instead of a comma in those cases. I think the blame falls on both the author and the editor. Also, the language sometimes bordered on casual (too many f-words and colloquial lingo) to flowery (sometimes overly complicated words pop up in an otherwise simple sentence, breaking the flow). But I am nitpicking here; overall the language is satisfactory.Some quotes are very good, especially this one: ‘Isn’t love the best festival that life celebrates?’. I liked these occasional philosophical touches that the author flavors the story with.The characterization of both the characters is quite good. The back stories are good, and their complex relationships with their families are written with a rare eloquence. Although the story could never pull my heartstrings enough to make me cry, I could feel for the characters throughout. Till the ending of the story, I was immersed in the story, the plot twists plunging me into a sea of intrigue. But alas, then came the ending, throwing me down a cliff of disappointment. It is really weird and unbelievable, throwing black ink over an otherwise well-weaved story. Although it is a fictional book, yet only if the story is a reflection of reality does it become more relatable to readers. In that aspect, the ending, in my humble opinion, totally fails.Be that as it may, this book is still a good one time read. I would rate it 3.3 stars out of 5. The author is talented, and I’m sure that in his next book, he will give me lesser reasons to complain and snatch a better rating from me.', '""A promise mad when in love, is the strongest one.""🧡* Book Review* 🔻A thousand times over - by Sudhanshu Bisen.•The cover of the book is simple, and the length is about 220 pages, so it is a light read.• I do not like the romance novels much but after reading the \' A thousand times over \' i think i am going to read romantic more often.

Since I have read her debut novel, I can very well say that her writing has improved in every essence. Starting from the plot line to the pace of book and rationalism of thoughts. I liked this one better than her last.Kaushik and Anushka are two ordinary people who fall in love with each other. And it's an ordinary story where they are separated due to circumstances. Circumstances that could very well have been avoided if the male protagonist had tried more. But well not going into summary and everything , I can just say I liked this plot a lot better than love struck's plot. But it's not enough. Cause, there are a lot of missed opportunities in the plot, the author failed to explore.The timeline is not strict. Some scenes which were supposed to be set back in 2005 , witness some quirks of 2017 . There are a few more slips like this but they are not of consequences, so I will not consider them. But what needed to be considered is that, probably the events of first half and the events of second half got exchanged. The scenes in first half couldn't convey the depth of their feelings as well the second half did.Personally I failed to connect with either of the protagonist in most part of the books. And I think the reason behind it is the lack of growth of characters. The growths are told but not shown. If you know what I mean. And I think the first half was not well thought of. It felt like she was unsure of how to project their romance. The story actually starts from the second half and I think she has the second part in mind so it was easy to pen it down. But the novel needed to see the chemistry and connection between the pair. Which she was unsure of. By throwing in a few lovemaking scenes if you think you can show the connection their , ma'am let me tell you doesn't work that way. The first half of their relationship seemed to be without substance, spark and most of all non-lucid.None of the characters are fully grown to their potentials. When you are talking about a transition of 10-12 years in someone's life , you can't simply show him/her lovelorn. There are people around them. If you want us to connect to them show us how they have deal with situations. Throwing a bit of this and then reverting back to past, throwing a bit of that and then refusing to come out of past is not going to help. We didn't get to See Anushka as the successful writer she is said to be. So, if I have to chose a side, I would chose Kaushik even after everything. Mostly because of his sense of duty and willingness to accept and acclimate to the changes happing around him.All in all this is a very very average story. And not at all unconventional like the previous attempt of Mrs. Roy. For which I would deduct half a point. And will revert that point back for giving us some rationality in the story this time.

And not just because of Peyton! But because of the premise. Somehow Eden Finley manages to make this fluffy and thoughtful. I especially related to Levi's 'don't abuse your privilege stance.' His emotions were genuine and the fact that when he walked the talked, it wasn't sugar-coated. Because it's harder to prove you really believe in your morals when things get uncomfortable. Peyton's inner debate about passion VS love was also heartwarming. A lot of authors like to skim past these practicalities and make it all gooey. But I've noticed Eden doesn't do that. I like my fluff to be reasonable. And with this I got a perfect mixture of romance and sensitivity. Miller and Talon were just the cherry on top.

Peyton had no such intention but he was bowled over by “his saviour”, and how gorgeous he looked.  They introduced themselves and chatted about their plans for College.He ended up having his first sexual intimacy with a guy.  Even though both enjoyed it they just ended up saying Goodbye and Peyton went on to Franklin U.Levington is the son of an elite Bostonian family with boundless wealth. He is going to Harvard Law school and will follow plans for his future, made by his overbearing father.  He hates his family and how they live on their unearned, handed down wealth. Wishing to live his own life, doing what he loves, he leaves Harvard.Informing his family that he is gay they don’t object when he decides to move to the other side of the country, California. Their happy that he won’t be in Boston or Chicago flaunting his sexuality among their socialite friends.When he transfers colleges he also changes his major from Law to Art without telling his father.That’s how Peyton and Levington came to meet for the second time, when Levi walks into Shenanigans pub at Franklin U.I’ve loved this Series at Franklin U and all the characters right from Book 1.  I think this is the last in the series which is sad but it was good to see all the previous characters surfacing here in Book 8.The 2 MC here had terrific chemistry with Levi more experienced than Peyton whose first ‘gay’ experience was with Levi on the rooftop of his Mansion home at their High school Graduation Party.

I never knew the extent to which a book can touch you and change you and make you suffer the ordeal of the characters. In particular the agony and helplessness of Marianne, a  simple sweet girl. The author teases and torments and leaves it to the reader's imagination about the actual events that take place with Marianne: was it consensual sex or rape ? This event affects the Mulvaneys hence the loaded 'were'. This is a book to be read especially by want-to -be-authors. It is a masterclass in writing."", 'Joyce Carol Oates has crafted a well thought out and quite intimate novel of a family, and family life in small-town America.  So here we meet the Mulvaneys as the story takes us back to earlier years.  Living on a relatively small-scale farm, and the father running a roofing company, whilst his wife runs her small antiques shop on the farm, so there are four children, three boys, and one girl.We start to get a good feeling for the family, and their sort of place in the local hierarchy and then we read of an event that happens to Marianne, the daughter of the family.  One thing is for sure, after this incident, on Valentine’s Day 1976, things will never be quite the same again.Why this works so well is because we can all identify somewhat with this story, although of course not all of us have a family member who suffers like Marianne, but as we know if we look at our own families there are certain quirks people have, and secrets kept by some from others.  We read of how Marianne copes (or doesn’t) with what happens to her, and the outrage and shock felt by the rest of the family, as they know they can never really get justice in a court of law, which really affects the father.  And thus, as the family slowly starts to disintegrate, we can see what the different members of the family decide to do next, how they cope, and how their preconceived ideas for the future start to alter.Bringing to life a family with all its warts and all, so this becomes a good dissection of a cohesive group who loses that cohesion, and how tragedy starts to become apparent.  This takes in the psychology of different people, and so we can see how religion may help some, whilst others seek assistance from elsewhere, including the bottom of a bottle.The end of this book though does hold out hope, not making this a tale of just gloom and doom, as we are taken to 1993, and a family reunion of sorts.  We read then of what the members of the family are up to, their ambitions and desires, and that with time, different outlooks and the loss of the patriarch, so things may be able to alter towards a deeper understanding and rapprochement between the family members.  Not only are the main characters brought to life, but so is the scenery and even the interactions with some of the pets.  Admittedly this is not a fast-paced tale by any means, but then it does really come to life in your hands as you feel the authenticity and power of the story, that has been so finely crafted.', ""A well drawn portrait of rural American family life. But SPOILER ALERT I couldn't get over the mother's acceptance and complicity in the treatment of the daughter following what was the defining event.  I kept expecting some sort of show- down between Marianne and her mother, or one of the boys and their parents regarding the parental treatment of their sister, some  come-uppance or reckoning or at least an attempt at justification by the mother for the cruel treatment; but it never happened and all the children seemed to adore Corinne (the mother) regardless.

Because of his strong recommendation, I read the book before I read the book\'s reviews in Amazon.com. I am fortunate to have read the book first, because reviews might have caused me to overlook an otherwise excellent book.  The value of a book is determined by what transpires between the author and the reader based on a complex intellectual, cultural and personal synchrony. For me, this is the perfect book. In my opinion, a good book satisfactorily answers three questions: Is the writing literate? Am I entertained? Have I learned anything?  Bernstein\'s book is not only literate, the writing is superb. He is a respected journalist, a book critic for the New York Times and an author of books. In my view, he and his editor have done a marvelous job in presenting a complex physical and contemplative journey that weave in and out of the present and the past, and encompass immense historical, cultural and spiritual domains.  Am I entertained? Tremendously! I appreciate his subtle humor and irony,even his dissatisfaction with his life and the frustration he experienced as he travels through China and central Asia. Anyone who really knows China would appreciate his humorous treatment of the bureaucracy, the peculiar and sometimes comic mindset and behavior of the people ( as seen from the Western viewpoint), and the overcrowding, dusty, monotonus cities. As a Chinese person, I don\'t think he is being arrogant or condescending. He was telling the truth and he hasn\'t told the worst.  Have I learned anything? An enormous amount! Born and raised in China, the first novel I read in 4th grade was ""Journey to the West."" It was about a Tang dynasty monk who went on a long journey to the ""Western Heaven"" in search of the sutra. The monk was accompanied by his three desciples: a monkey and a pig in human forms and Frior Sand. The pig was greedy, the monkey cunning and they have supernatural power that had protected the monk from demons and wild beasts on the way. The book was an all time classic,loved by children through the ages, but it was a mythological novel. Now in my golden years, I am thrilled to learn the truth about the Tang monk Hsuan Tsang, his incredible 16-year journey to India, the landscape, the history and the politics, then and now.  I am delighted to learn about the modern-day pilgrim Richard Bernstein, his childhood, his ethnic and religious background, how he started his career, his inner thoughts and feelings. It sounds like a fairy tale that a Jewish boy from a chicken farm in Connecticut and a girl from a State farm in Helongjian undertake a joint adventure retracing the steps of a 7th century Chinese monk!  Frankly I am puzzled by the criticism,obviously from younger readers,that the book was fueled by Bernstein\'s mid-life crisis and that he traveled by jet planes and puddle-jumped from one nice hotel to the next. True, had he undertaken the journey while in his twenties, he would have been physically more adventurous, he might have climbed the icy mountains, crossed the scorching desert on camel back just as the Tang monk had done.But then we have to wait 16 years to read his chronicle assuming he survived. Had he undertaken this journey as a young man, I am not sure he would have had nearly as much wisdom and insight as he does in his fifties.  Last, but not the least, is the love story. Again I can relate to his loneliness as an unmarried person, and his ambivelence about commitment. Lukily for Bernstein, he found love in the nick of time. I hope he and Zongmei have beautiful, dark-eyed children and live happily ever after.H. Mei Liu, M.D. author of GRANDFATHER\'S MICROSCOPE', 'While not qualified to judge the author\'s comments on Buddhism, the book, for me, was one of the best travel books I\'ve ever read.  For some reason, Central Asia with its blood-stirring names -- Tashkent, Samarkand, the Silk Road, etc. -- has always fascinated me.  Bernstein, in his 50s, did what I, now in my 60s, would have liked to have done but didn\'t -- travel the Silk Road and exotic points beyond.  Perhaps his struggle with his mid-life crisis made his book all the more poignant to this old coot, but I found the story of the monk searching for truth and the story of the journalist searching for himself nicely completmentary.  By the time I had finished this delightful book, I felt that I had accompanied the author along the way.  And if Bernstein can do that for me, then I pronounce ""Ultimate Journey"" a helluva good read.', 'Bernstein has accomplished what few other travel writers are able to achieve. Think Colin Thrubon, Peter Mathiessen, Tony Horowitz -- Bernstein\'s rich background not only in Chinese History but English Literature ( Joyce, TS Eliot) -- expand the narrative to touch universal issues; this talent coupled with his sensory impressions of India are consistently entertaining-- I highly reccomend this volume -- think Snow Leopard, Behind the Wall, Blue Lattitudes-- ignore the pedantic ""scholarly "" reviews which call to mind the jealousy of academia over Barbra Tuchman\'s gift for historical narrative -- a gift that shames the the tedious Thomistic penchant of academia to constantly ""cough ink"" when they pick up a pen!']";From the Publisher In 629, the revered Buddhist monk Hsuan Tsang set out across Asia in search of the Ultimate Truth, and to settle what he called “the perplexities of my mind.” From the Tang dynasty capital at Xian through ancient Silk Road oases, over forbidding mountain passes to Tashkent, Samarkand, and the Amu-Darya River, across Pakistan to the holiest cities of India–and back again–his sixteen-year journey was beset with every hardship imaginable. Pilgrimage complete, Hsuan Tsang wrote an account of his trek that is still considered one of the classics of Chinese literature. In 1998, Richard Bernstein, venerated journalist

The impact of mechanisation, urbanisation, automation and “networking” – the provision of utilities including water and waste disposal, electricity, the postal service and telephony – freed Americans from much of the drudgery of their previous rural existence, gave them decent houses to live in with sanitary environments, shifted many into  jobs which paid better but imposed less wear and tear on their bodies, gave them heat and light on demand thereby increasing the amount of time they had to pursue activities other than work, and enabled them to receive a cornucopia of consumer goods from mail order companies. Houses filled up with refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and other consumer electricals. Eating food was no longer one of the daily hazards they faced.The years 1940 to 1970 were, if anything, even more spectacular. Wages increased even more as productivity boomed. Highways were built which enabled easy travel from all corners of the nation to all of the others. Driveways filled up with automobiles. Air travel became increasingly accessible to everyone, not just the financial elite. And on long hot humid summer days Americans could take refuge in their air conditioning.Then, with the exception of a brief spurt between 1996 and 2004, the helter skelter growth slowed to an amble. A rust belt developed in areas previously frenetic with production of steel, cars and other goods. The ICT “revolution”, heralded as the bringer of new industrial and domestic advances on a par with those of electricity and the internal combustion engine, has so far failed to deliver in such a grand manner. There’s a limit to the extent to which cat videos and 140-character prattlings can improve the standard of living.Robert J Gordon’s story of this great unfurling of the American dream is captivating in two ways: first in showing how the meteoric rise and subsequent plateauing (it’s overdramatic to characterise it as a fall, really) came about, using some of the same old sources, though in slightly different ways, maybe, and also drawing on resources such as back-issues of the Sears catalogue to trace the way in which American households advanced from home-made everything, including virtually all clothes, to the ability to order everything – clothes, white goods, musical instruments (the number of musicians who made their start on Sears catalogue instruments, which Gordon doesn’t go into, is phenomenal), and so on – via the postman.But he also tracks how things have stagnated: with all of the waiting around at airports and all the other attendant hassles of flying it now takes longer by jet to fly New York-LA than it did in the day of propeller-driven aeroplanes, and with all the little extras, like paying for luggage to be carried and food on the flight, both of which used to be included in the fare, it’s more expensive too.Gordon is not, however, blaming anyone or anything in particular. The problem is, he suggests, that all the good stuff has been done, and everything now is just new ways of doing those things (emails for letters, online orders for mail orders, incremental improvements in TV picture definition, DVDs or Netflix for videos or the cinema, and so on). Likewise with productivity: ICT may be able to achieve improvements, but the potential is nowhere near as striking as that for advances of previous industrial revolutions.In his final chapter, then, he advances proposals not so much for kick-starting a productivity revival as for alleviating the fallout of its demise. Like Thomas Piketty, whom he makes a point of acknowledging and citing, he recognises the enormous chasm that has opened up between top and bottom of American society. In a particularly poignant chart he shows how between 1945 and 1975 – the years of the “great compression” - incomes advanced at similar rates across American society, and how since then the top 10% have continued to enjoy steady growth (those at the very top, as Piketty pointed out, have enjoyed obscene growth in their wealth in comparative terms) whilst those at the bottom have suffered ongoing contraction.In all, I would rate this book, as a piece of economic history, almost on a par with the works of Landes (The Unbound Prometheus and The Wealth And Poverty Of Nations), as a research piece at least in the same ball park as Piketty’s Capital (yes, I have read it), and as a piece to dip into alongside Porter’s three best-known works (yep, I read them too; I didn’t just look at the pictures).Nevertheless, like all of those publications, it also deserves, demands even, critical appraisal. For starters, I find the central thesis too alarmist, like the head of the US Patent Office at the turn of the 20th Century believing he could close it down as everything had already been invented. There are many reasons for guarded optimism. The Economist recently ran a Special Report outlining some of the many potential productivity improvements in Agriculture in the pipeline (if only we could get past the Frankenfoods pitchforks and torches in the dark mentality some of them may one day get used). Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing to most of us) has only just begun to find its role, so far in specific niches, but plenty of work is being done on breaking loose of that straitjacket. And who knows, somewhere within ICT there is that killer app like the motor car or electric lighting waiting to be found (I don’t think the so-called “internet of everything” is it, though; I don’t need my fridge to tell me I’m out of milk, thanks).Secondly, Gordon appears to dismiss out of hand the role of government in revitalisation, but as Mariana Mazzucato and Carla Perez, among others, have pointed out, without government there would be no internet, no ICT revolution, no (shock horror) iPhone. In The Entrepreneurial State, Mazzucato advanced the idea that government could be doing far more for the development of alternative energy.Furthermore, without the government-built network of Interstate Highways, what would Americans do with all those cars?Thirdly, Gordon gives a very confusing account of the benefits of immigration. First he assigns responsibility to immigration for bringing down wages in some sectors, then seems to be saying that it is really only the wages of immigrants that are affected. He partly credits immigration control in the US after the second world war for rising wages, but makes no mention of the many Mexicans who moved, under the Programa Bracero, to the US during the period covered by that war and the one in Korea in order to fill in for the Americans serving in the armed forces, which saw the Mexican population in the US double to five million. And he proposes a points system for permitting immigrants to enter the US, making the classic economist’s mistake of commodifying people, in the belief that a price can be put on everything.And finally, at least for this review, there is Gordon’s US-centricity, almost to the exception of everywhere else. One of the great strengths of Piketty’s work was that whilst it spoke of “Les Trente Glorieuses”, it did so in an international context. Gordon’s “Great Leap Forward” only applies to the US. There is nothing in Gordon about how improving economies in the rest of the world may benefit the US. The rest of the world more or less doesn’t exist in the bubble he constructs.However, to reemphasise my earlier point, notwithstanding a few quibbles I consider this book to be of extraordinary value: a record of spectacular progress and how it was achieved, and a warning that, unless somebody brings more beer, the party’s over.', ""Should you be tempted by this book, bear in mind two factors: firstly, it's written by an American economist and secondly, the title says it all. Essentially the entire book is a comparison of American Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and how this was influenced by a relatively small number of key inventions. According to Robert J. Gordon, this particular group of  inventions are all only influential once, after which they may only be subject to what might be considered additional fine-tuning, for example (and this is far from a complete listing), the internal combustion engine, the Ford model T automobile, aircraft, the telephone and last but not least, electricity, indoor plumbing, heating and air-conditioning. Gordon argues that these are all what could be termed one-off inventions. All highly significant, particularly the automobile, which due to its relatively quick reduction in cost, coupled with credit payment schemes enabled all but the destitute to experience a significant change for the better in their lifestyle. The book spans three time periods: 1870 to 1940; 1940 to 1970 (and these two periods  are probably the most significant, since the major developments took place over this century) and finally, 1970 to 2004, at which point American growth stuttered. Now it is not unreasonable to flag-up the so-called digital revolution as an example of a more recent one-off invention but Gordon argues that all may not be quite what it appears, after all, are some of these just global recycling, the ubiquitous email in place of typed or hand-written letters, mail order shopping now online shopping. Agreed, email and online shopping are more convenient but the point Gordon is making is that these inventions did not and still do not have quite the same impact as the automobile or for that matter, the telephone. There will no doubt be much heated debate on the overall argument but nonetheless, Gordon does have a point but bear in mind, the arbiter in this whole issue is the slide and reasons behind the reduction in GDP since 1970, that period from the end of the Civil War to what might be considered the end of really big inventions. One last point, on page 21 of the paperback imprint, Gordon seems to have overlooked one very significant British inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. Now in case its escaped anyone's notice, he's the chap who invented the World Wide Web! The research and presentation of Gordon's argument are excellent and raise some interesting points."", 'This is an excellent book on economic growth and an implicit critique of its measurement.It is rich in detail and well supported with evidence.As a reader it is well written therefore it’s length was not an issue for me though it could be a consideration for some (it is a heavy book even in paperback form).If I am going to say anything critical I would say a more ruthless editor could have made a difference and not lost any of the central message. Secondly I would point out that the policy prescriptions in the final chapter are a bit on the weak side and less sophisticated than the historical analysis that supports them.']";How America's high standard of living came to be and why future growth is under threatIn the century after the Civil War, an economic revolution improved the American standard of living in ways previously unimaginable. Electric lighting, indoor plumbing, motor vehicles, air travel, and television transformed households and workplaces. But has that era of unprecedented growth come to an end? Weaving together a vivid narrative, historical anecdotes, and economic analysis, The Rise and Fall of American Growth challenges the view that economic growth will continue unabated, and demonstrates that the life-altering scale of innovations between 1870 and 1970 cannot be

However, my Husband has enjoyed it very much"", 'Oddly but wonderfully written biography by the daughter of a plains homesteader.Brutally honest.  Her Father would be classified as a narcissistic sociopath by today\'s standards;""My way or the highway"".Men back 100 years ago followed the biblical tenet: wives obey their master.If you can stomach the man through this, he proves to be a frontier friendly person.He took in many a stray.He was a brilliant, tenacious horticulturalist...he had to be both to endure the harsh weather and landscape that was / is present in western Nebraska.Like those first pioneers across the Great American Desert, he persevered.Land ownership was more than his ideal...it was his mantra.A great read...I love this author\'s storytelling methods & vocabulary.Brilliant!', 'Old Jules is a fascinating look at life on the northern Great Plains and provides a great counter to the sanitized versions of America\'s frontier, for those of us that learned about it through media like ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Bonanza"" style depictions. For that, it is a great book.But it is up to each reader to decide if Jules was a great guy who succeeded despite the tribulations and hardships of his place and time, or if he was an abusive husband/father who fled his prior home and simply did as he pleased for the rest of his life. This is the enigma...My own opinion is that Jules was somewhat mentally unstable. His leaving Switzerland is understandable, despite the vast majority of immigrants from Europe having been from lower class families than his who had rather more limited opportunities in the \'old country\'. By that I mean the West had plenty of cultured people who were attracted to the openess of the frontier (both societal and geo-physical); we just don\'t hear so much about them. This story indicates he was educated and may have been a medical student, although it\'s left speculative. He apparently consulted frontier doctors, and performed rude medicinal and sanitary practices that don\'t square with what one could safely assume he ought to know if he had medical training (even for those times). Although both author/daughter Mari Sandoz and her younger brother (who wrote ""Son of Old Jules"") later dismissed the idea that their childhoods were unusual for that place and time, they clearly were extreme. Possible explanations for his lack of concern for his family never really come out inthe book.I highly recommend the book. It begins immediately after the ""Indian Wars"" period but before society with its laws and structure had really taken hold. One thing I was unaware of is the prevalence of suicide in those days: it seems to have been fairly common among settlers who reached the end of their endurance (this occurs in another famous book ""My Antonia"" by Willa Cather. Though technically fiction, Cather\'s book is the same timeframe and is based on real people and events she knew as a child). There is also mention of several cases of people being sent East to asylums. They just couldn\'t take the hardship of their ordeals.For me, the biggest problem in understanding Jules the man is trying to square his upbringing (young Swiss priveleged playboy/student) with what he became (a greasy old man who disdained government - despite the letters he wrote and his advocacy of the farmers versus cattlemen in the stuggle to control western Nebraska - and who had minimal concern for his own family).I wonder if some sort of movie could be made of the story. It tells a lot about the REAL frontier and its hardships, rather than the ""log cabin"" or ""cowboy"" themes we\'re all used to. This era is almost forgotten today. Notice that you can today buy homes modeled on log cabins, of which there are any number of restored examples - but there are almost no old sod houses left. Its almost like there\'s no nostalgia for that epoch of American history, which is telling by itself.']";"First published in 1935, Old Jules is unquestionably Mari Sandoz's masterpiece. This portrait of her pioneer father grew out of """"the silent hours of listening behind the stove or the wood box, when it was assumed, of course, that I was asleep in bed.""""

Brownmiller meticulously documents the prevalence of rape throughout history, and the patriarchal efforts to deny and conceal it, while remaining critically analytical and even handed. As a man, there were many times when I wanted to take a break from the relentless accounts of sexual violence but persevered when reminded by the author that what might be shocking for some men is the lived experience of many women since the dawn of time. Doubtless like many other men I view myself as someone incapable of rape but Brownmiller highlights how all men share a responsibility for changing a culture that eroticises objectification and violence. The price paid by women is to live in a state of constant terror. Perhaps it is not true that all men are capable of rape, although her research suggests that, at the very least, most are capable of collusion. However, it remains the case that every man can legitimately be viewed as a potential rapist by women until all men accept responsibility for bringing about a massive cultural shift. For anyone sceptical of her claims, there is an easy piece of verification. Against Our Will was published in 1975, the same year as Peter Sutcliffe began his murder spree. A recent Netflix documentary The Yorkshire Ripper outlines the police investigation of Sutcliffe and demonstrates the many failings that arose from a lack of concern and understanding of sex crime, leading to women unnecessarily living in fear for years. 45 years later we still have a long way to go.

This is in most part a slice of life novel as the narrator Ono goes through his daily chores all the while reminiscing about his past life as an art student and then as a propaganda artist at the wartime for Japan, which in itself is not an intriguing plot. But what make this one work is the smooth flow of prose that keeps you occupied without being all too overbearing, flipping page after page to just experience the goodness of it. It just makes you feel for an old timer like Ono who tries hard to be relevant in the current times and justify the same to his daughters and his friends. As he continues to paint every current situation and dialog into his past as he searches for reason.

One is how he recalls...there is no chronological order to his recollection...small things/incidents/people...trigger recollections which apperantly have nothing to do with what triggred the recollection...but slowly the reader establishes the connection. The second is there is no specific storyline...the recollections of the artist form a very broad theme framework within which the author explores multiple themes. In short it can be called a desultory conversation telling you a lot more finally than was your exceptation...leaving you overwhelmed. Perhaps that's not the only thing  which overwhelms you.

Sent to investigate an apparent suicide, Zen soon discovers there is more going on than meets the eye.  It's a good opportunity for Michael Dibdin to explore the murky world of church and state politics, and along the way there are also some great insights into the shallow world of fashion and early 1990s consumer culture.  The writing is witty and laced with black, world-weary humour and as usual Zen is the driving force for the story.  The complexity of his personality and the frustrations he encounters makes for an entertaining companion.  As with the first book in the series, the  plot seems a bit over-done and needs some unpicking at the end, which leads to a slightly rushed conclusion.  Re-reading the series now, it is striking what a fine writer about modern Italy Michael Dibdin was.  He would have made a brilliant travel writer with his style and observations.  Enjoyable, but also tinged with sadness, to think that Dibdin, who died at the age of 60 in 2007, is no longer around to write more wonderful books."", 'There\'s this joke I know where this driver stops someone and asks for directions, only to be told ""Well if I was going there, I wouldn\'t start from here."" I feel the same about the Aurelio Zen series of books. If I had the chance to start the series again, I wouldn\'t start from here.The start of the book was very good. Zen is asked to go to the Vatican to investigate a seeming suicide of a jumper from the dome of St. Peter\'s. The cardinals know people distrust their pronouncements, especially, when it comes notable bankers who helped run their bank (the book is written a little while after Roberto Calvi died, and money and the church bank was the big issue facing the church).The problem is, as the book goes on, you can guess who the murderer is. He keeps cropping up for no reason I can see, other than reminding people he\'s there. There aren\'t many clues, but then there aren\'t many suspects either, save this shadowy ""Cabal"" who have been getting up to nefarious wrong doings, according to the deceased.The other issue I have is it turning into something Benny Hill would write at the end, if he was writing a whodunit. In my mind I was almost hearing that silly ""chase music"" he used to use at the end of each episode while Zen chased the bad guys. When that\'s happening, you know the book/denouement isn\'t going well.', ""This is the third book in the series featuring Aurelio Zen, a detective from Venice. Each book is set in a different location, in this case Rome, since the cabal in question is thought to be a secret society operating within the Vatican. This review contains a mild spoiler concerning Zen’s love life.The starting point is the death of  Prince Ludovico Ruspanti, who falls a hundred and fifty feet to his death in the chapel at St. Peter's in Rome. Zen is invited to investigate the death. Though the Italian police have no jurisdiction within the Vatican, the church authorities want an outsider to investigate to allay any suspicion that they might have something to do with it.There is a second line to the plot concerning the relationship between Zen and his lover, Tania Biacis, whom we met in the previous title. With no justification whatsoever, each becomes suspicious of the other, though their misunderstandings are resolved in due course. Tania is a civil servant who, if Dibdin is to believed, is but one of many using her working hours to run a private business. Zen is unaware of this fact, and of the fact that she is actually very well off, and is spending money he can ill afford, but she could, renting a flat for her. The question of Tania’s money arises early in the book, when he sees her wearing an expensive outfit by the famous designer, Falco (Falcone). When he learns how successful she is, it spurs his competitive instinct, but his attempt to make money backfires badly.The plot is complex and the standard of writing very high, as is always the case with this author. While the death of Ruspanti is well explained (as are the two subsequent deaths) I felt there were two weaknesses. The invention is whimsical in places, most notably when Zen goes to consult a young computer hacker. And the ending is foreshortened, the book coming to a somewhat abrupt conclusion. In particular, I would have liked at least a hint as to what happened to Falco and his talented but unfortunate sister, Ariana.""]";In Cabal, master crime writer Michael Dibdin plunges us into a murky world of church spies, secret societies, cover-ups, and mistaken identities. An apparent suicide in the Vatican may in fact have been a muder conducted by a centuries-old cabal within The Knights of Columbus. A discovery among the medieval manuscripts of the Vatican Library leads to a second death, Zen travels to Milan, where he faces a final, dramatic showdown. Meanwhile, Zen's lover, the tantalizing Tania, is conducting her own covert operations--which could well jeopardize everything Zen has worked for.

This is generally considered the essential sci-fi.  The story is mesmerizing, even after finishing the book the effect of the story, the characters, still linger in your mind. The story is simple enough, a murder investigation. But that only forms the surface of the main plot. But, if you observe, behind the dialogues, the world building, lies a hidden meaning. The dialogues throw a direct punch to the present human state, and how we are destroying the one home we call EARTH.  The characters are well developed. At the end, you\'ll find yourself having sympathy for a robot. The story doesn\'t slow down anywhere. The action starts right from the 3rd page. The writing is also not very complicated and there is a unique flow to the chapters. The backstory of the events is described throughout the story, mainly, how earth ended up the way it was, why humanity had to live in large underground ""Steel Caves"". There are also some philosophical thoughts thrown in some of the dialogue.  This is a story which hides a deeper meaning within its facade. There is philosophy, politics, and mass hysteria.  What\'s profound about the story is its relevancy to the present world. I sometimes caught myself wondering whether the future mentioned in the book, might eventually catch up to us. Because the present condition of the world is eerily like the ones mentioned in the book. Perhaps, Asimov did predict the future. One of the greatest things about the book is the class system, it mocks our present state of inequality, income differences and the social structure. The prose is quite detailed and rich in meaning.  Overall, this is one of the greatest Sci-Fi books for a reason.

It also has introduction by Margaret Atwood and David Bradshaw. Besides that the book is obviously a must read.', ""The title of the book is taken from a line in Shakespeare’s The Tempest – “O brave new world, that has such people in it!” – uttered by the character Miranda who has grown up in an isolated society and sees a large number of people for the first time. Huxley’s Brave New World is about the clash between the Miranda-like protagonist, John (who incidentally has read only Shakespeare while growing up), who lives in an isolated settlement, and a world where humans are engineered in labs to lead a perfectly contented life.The first third of the book describes the dystopian World State where everything, ranging from procreation to employment to recreation, is created and controlled artificially in line with its motto of “Community, Identity, Stability”. Humans are artificially produced in batches and divided into a caste system ranging from Alpha Plus to Epsilon Minus, conditioned from the embryo stage. They (including the lower castes) lead a happy life driven by technology, promiscuity and a drug called “soma” – overall a “civilized infantility” as Huxley puts it. Henry Ford seems to be the presiding god of this world, possibly in line with his famous assembly line system of manufacturing.The second part deals with the exploration of a “savage” settlement, where people live the old-fashioned way, by Bernard Marx (an Alpha Plus but one who does not wish to conform to the ideal world, like his friend Helmholtz Watson) and his date of the moment, Lenina Crowne. They meet John, a naturally created offspring of a senior functionary of the World State, but one who has grown up oblivious to it. The final part is about John, like Miranda, trying to blend in the World State and the inherent conflicts that it creates. The highlights of this part, in my view, are the discussions between John and Mustapha Mond, the controller. It’s about the eventual salvation of Bernard and Helmholtz and the only possible conclusion of John’s story.Brave New World, like 1984 published 17 years later, discusses a dystopian world and the perils therein. But the books’ approaches to this end are significantly different – the latter explores control through fear while the former sees pleasure as a tool for control. Brave New World is an interesting and short read about the clash between those who want to “get rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it” and others who would like to “claim the right to be unhappy”, while simultaneously discussing issues such as racism and casteism.It's easy to see that it would have been a radical book in 1932. It obviously is significantly less so today which makes this book seem obsolete at times. But if one can get past it or if possible, read this book through the lens of a 1930s reader, the book is an extremely interesting and rewarding read.Pros: Fascinating setting, using Shakespeare as an interesting metaphor, easy readCons: May seem a bit outdated now""]";Brave new world is a dystopian novel by British author Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932.

And by unique, I mean unique in every sense, including dark humor, language, and the way Alex has with music.To those voracious readers of this ever-growing community, have you ever thought before picking up this book that it will be a hard read? Let me answer you. You will find the first chapter hard, I agree. But as you go on, you will find that most of the words are repeating themselves. The novel will be engrossing after this point. If you enjoy reading, then you will understand the meaning of Nadsat words from the sentence itself. The language is also pretty comical. Especially the words for 'good' and 'God.'Then there is the music. Rock music was taking baby steps during the time this novel is set, that in the 1970s. But still, it was prevalent. And look at Alexander the Large's interests- Beethoven and Bach. Music is a nice element of this novel; for Alex, it is at first a pleasure, but later on, after the therapy, it is torture for him. A toying with his brains is what changed his response to music.The humor- my god, it is out of this world! I mean, there is a limit to black comedy also, like all genres. But Burgess defied those boundaries and changed the way of this sub-genre forever. And speaking of limits, how can I forget Kubrick's film.Kubrick's film is highly artistic, without a doubt. Not as futuristic and resplendent as '2001: A Space Odyssey', though. He has a habit of changing details, and adding that extra 'spice.' That is what I like about him. But the novel is entirely different than the film. Both the novel and the movie are good in their own way. The former uses background music to lift its humorous tone. The latter uses language. But there as some similarities too. They do not glorify violence; on the contrary, they use violence as a recurring theme to strike a ground reality in the readers. The harsh reality is that the future is not bright.The story is told from the perspective of Alex, our protagonist. The theme is simple enough: is it better for a man to be bad than to be made good forcefully? And to this, Burgess replies yes.  The person must himself realize his faults. He must be an orange, capable of coherent thought and decisions, not a clockwork, made to be better by force. The idea is disturbing and thought-provoking at the same time."", ""It's a nice copy but all books from Amazon always come with some marks ruining the look of the book."", ""The book is infamous for it's violent and vulgar content but that is just part of the charm of this book. It can be a tedious read given the fact that the language used by the characters in this book (nadsat) can be a little difficult to comprehend and might take some time to register in your mind and to get used to but you can find an appendix or a glossary of those words on the wikipedia which quite frankly helped me get through the book with ease. As for the plot, it needs no introduction. It is classic and a benchmark in the history of novels for the way it's written and the emotions it induces in the mind of the reader.""]";"A vicious fifteen-year-old droog is the central character of this 1963 classic. In Anthony Burgess's nightmare vision of the future, where the criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology. A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. When the state undertakes to reform Alex to ""redeem"" him, the novel asks, ""At what cost?""

He was primarily influenced by his friend Max Demian, after whom the novel is named. Demian is Sinclair's friend, but he could also be described as his spiritual mentor.

It's a quick and easy read, less than 200 pages long, and it just flows so well. It's the kind of book that makes you think and reflect. Hesse is a wonderful writer who has an impact on his readers because he writes such intelligent and deep thoughts. I remember sitting there near the end of the novel, practically rethinking my entire existence.This book is ideal for anyone interested in spiritual or psychological novels, as these are the novel's two main themes.

The result is that we are launched immediately into Jergovic\'s world - which is probably just as well. This anthology of powerful short stories can therefore speak for itself and stand on its own.Having visited Sarajevo recently, I kept on trying to imagine what it must have been like constantly to fear snipers and mortars from the surrounding hills. The hills loom large, of course, still, though the dangers have thankfully gone. It is just so inconceivable that in the 20th Century, months-long siege warfare (a phrase that has positively mediaeval echoes) still took place - and this in the era of TV cameras and 24 hour news cycles...And yet this book does go a long way to help the outsider to be immersed. These short stories (and they are nearly all very short) powerfully capture what it must have been like. The evoke the sounds, the fears, the despair - above all they evoke the humanity of Sarajevo. For as such traumatic episodes in European history recede into the past, it is all too easy (for those with any interest in such tragedies at all) to focus on the statistics and decisions made in far-away conference rooms. But books like this won\'t allow that. The fear and the despair are expressed on faces with names, they are expressed by people with pasts and memories. Shared experience from decades of living together, memories of who did what during the Second World War (say) are carried into the present, so that these inform who the individuals and their families are.Ignorant and unaware of such legacies (inevitably), outsiders come in, looking for a story perhaps: like the nameless American journalist in the story from which the book gets its title (Sarajevo Marlboro was one of a number of localised cigarette brands Philip Morris produced for different markets). The gravedigger he is interviewing comes to realise that it will be impossible for this outsider to understand what being a Sarajevan is like. Not because outsiders must inevitably struggle with that - but because he\'s not really prepared to try to understand. He just needs his story. So, the gravedigger depressingly realises he would have been better off saying \'we are an unhappy and unarmed people who are being killed by Chetnik [i.e. Serbian nationalist] beasts, and that we\'ve all gone crazy with bereavement and grief\' (The Gravedigger, p84), and thus complying with outsiders\' assumptions, rather than trying to explain nuances. For from the inside, a refrain could be \'it\'s never quite as simple as that.Which of course does mean that it is hard for outsiders to understand, inevitably. But we can learn to empathise. And these stories help us do just that. From the daydreamer who feels he simply can\'t leave or function well outside his home city of Sarajevo to the man surprised to be given a cactus by his girlfriend; from the retired boxer in a bar who can\'t help himself from raising his fists and punching whenever the bell of a passing tram is rung, to the woman in a fairytale marriage who discovers the photograph of her husband\'s lover when his personal affects are returned to her on his death at the front. Tragedies, agonies, histories. These are all very human realities.And yet through it all, there is resilience and hope. The stories are beautifully, if sparsely, told. Every word is weighty, but every story economical - everything a short story should be, in fact. They all serve to illustrate in some way or another how life goes on even under a siege, to prove that people, through life together and hope for something else (however vague or wishful), can get through. Somehow.But this is not light reading, nor gentle escapism. Far from it. It is immersive and disturbing.The words that introduce one story (called \'Bosnian Hotpot\') have stuck in my mind ever since, and they could stand as an explanation for the whole anthology."" \'I know what the speed of light is, but we haven\'t learned about the speed of darkness yet\' - Dino from Zenica, twelve years old, temporarily at school in Zagreb"" (p35)', 'This is the human testimonial of the Sarajevo siege.

(And no, using a word incorrectly doesn\'t quality as being different or ""artistic."")I enjoy fictional history and didn\'t mind the side trips into early criminology, though they started to drag at end of the story.The book is fairly descriptive, dwelling a great deal on Hungarian country superstitions. She has what could be interesting characters, but there is little depth to them and  their motivation is indirect and muddy. The impression is that the author is merely trying on different pieces of period clothing and ""poising"" for us.After reading this book, I\'m left with the feeling that the author either doesn\'t like to read the kind of book she wrote  or that this is just another artistic project, one she can cross off on her list of fashionable things to do.Because so many readers have pointed out the loose ends, I won\'t repeat them.  There are hints to settle them, but written in a vauge, unsatisfying manner.

On one hand it treats Hester almost like a proto-feminist figure, undaunted and dignified in the face of public disgrace, one who earns her own living to raise her child and on the other, she is readily accepting of her own persecution.Similarly, Dimmesdale is torn between his emotional urges and his allegiance to a doctrine which denies him his humanity. Oppressed by the faith he clings on to for meaning and validation, he chooses private anguish over a public fall from grace quite consciously. In a way, he willingly remains a cog in the wheel of the Puritan machinery while subconsciously resenting the fact of his bondage. The author\'s treatment of Chillingworth is perhaps the most paradoxical. He is cast in the role of the Biblical snake, a decrepit looking man of intellect, but shown to be a strangely sympathetic cuckold at the same time who refrains from slut-shaming Hester and goes as far as admitting to his own failings as a husband, an astonishing and laudable character trait. I am not sure what was the point of linking natural intelligence with evil though.But let us decontextualize first. Because what good would it do to pan the tyranny of the Puritanical worldview in this day and age? And haven\'t re-envisioned Biblical scenarios already lost their sheen?Let us take the scarlet letter instead - the incriminating \'A\', a mark of woman\'s ultimate disgrace that Hester bears like a badge of honour in the last stretch, perhaps, having appropriated its connotative worth as a social censure and transmuted it into a part of her identity. Undoubtedly it is the most interesting thing about the novel, because the very weapon of social ostracism wielded against Hester contributes towards her maturation as a character and unwittingly bestows on her the capacity for unfettered thought and freedom of movement. By cementing her status as an outsider, it accords her the unique opportunity of spotting the limitations of a community imprisoned by its own conservatism and aids the process of her liberation and education.It might be a stretch to call the letter a symbol for female emancipation but the text is my guide and the author is dead (in the Barthesian sense) so I\'ll draw my own conclusions.Sample one of her observations as evidence -""Indeed, the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood. Was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them?""My biggest quibble with the book is its insistence on viewing Dimmesdale as a co-equal sufferer as Hester, victim of his own mounting contrition and Chillingworth\'s insidious revenge. As if Dimmesdale suffers as much as the woman banished to the very margins of society wherein she is forced to raise a child on her own and endure the objectifying gaze of men and women silently pillorying her existence. It seems only Pearl, often referred to as a \'demon offspring\', a living embodiment of the repudiation of all doctrinal dogma, is quick to identify her father\'s moral hypocrisy -""What a strange, sad man is he!"" said the child, as if speaking partly to herself. ""In the dark nighttime he calls us to him, and holds thy hand and mine, as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder! And in the deep forest, where only the old trees can hear, and the strip of sky see it, he talks with thee, sitting on a heap of moss! And he kisses my forehead, too, so that the little brook would hardly wash it off! But, here, in the sunny day, and among all the people, he knows us not; nor must we know him! A strange, sad man is he, with his hand always over his heart!""Even the denouement is fashioned with the sole purpose of salvaging Dimmesdale\'s lost self esteem and paving the way for his atonement. His guilt-ridden conscience is the center of his universe, not the welfare of the woman he abandons to a fate of enduring countless indignities. And his decision to go out in a blaze of pseudo-heroic glory by finally confessing to his \'sin\' publicly is further evidence of his self-serving nature. If anything it proves to be his second act of traitorous desertion of Hester, in which he cruelly stamps out her last hope of beginning a new life elsewhere with the father of her child.Thus, I\'d remember him as a representative figure of the Puritan moral machinery which flounders in its attempts to maintain its infallibility in the face of sobering reality.Further, the elevation of Hester to a Christ-like symbol of suffering and self-sacrifice who graduates beyond the confines of the world of flesh to attain a near-mythical status is deeply problematic. It vitiates the fact of her growth as a woman of independent means whose very presence, albeit in the fringes of society, serves as an existential threat to the patriarchal Puritan set-up.The omniscient narrator\'s interjections serve as additional irritants especially because he feels like he has to expatiate on the symbolism of the letter, Chillingworth and Pearl time and again for the sake of the reader\'s benefit. We get it, Mr Hawthorne. You like insulting the reader\'s intelligence. Lastly, since the narrative mostly develops around the tension between conflicting ideologies it becomes a bit too involved with its own didacticism, often reducing its characters to mere stiff mouthpieces or symbols. It fails to create any dramatic suspense. As a result there\'s very little pleasure to be derived from reading.Tl;dr, this is probably not a feminist novel. But of all the things that stand out for me, the author\'s indirect indictment of slut-shaming remains the foremost. For obvious reasons.

Forget the narrative subtleties, forget the mammoth-whale chase and forget all the cetological whalelore, if not the geo-aesthetics, and we are left with the sea – the omnipotent, omnipresent and the omnicidal. But between the potency and the presence lies the chasm upon which the phantom feeds. The phantom is but a whale, haunting and haunted; and Moby-Dick is neither about a whale nor about the chase. It is about the monstrosity of the sea that undulates within the interstices of the hull – the tremor of which is never seen but only felt in the prosthesis of the spine. It is about the intensities and the multi-variegated interface of the oblique waves that refracts too less of geometry then rejects all that we managed to grasp. Too much of spermaceti but too little is the light to illumine the abyss of the thalassic mind.O Reader, do you think it’s about a monomaniac vengeance? Well then, offend I must the humanists, for the topological multiplicity of the oceanic offers a yawning analysis of that grinning jawbone chased by a prosthetic-legged man, for when they meet each other, a shudder of the flukes sends splinters into the heart that holds the harpoon – a paroxysm of grief and all that we have lost in the singular spasm of the sea. It is not about vengeance but about the viperous obliquity of the splash that carries enough venom to deafen the mad. The splash is present in the arcs of the spine and the phantom-whale is but a figment of the splash upon that ancient spine and to hunt it is the inception of Vikriti upon the Virat and all the grandeur in catastrophic harmony gathers into a vortex upon which hovers a single “black bubble”, where the disreality of non-utterance concentrates and atomizes perpetually. We are but forced to lunge into it only to emerge out again into an event of disbelief where our hammers freeze and all tongues collapse but the red flag that was yet to be nailed into the mainmast-head ripples quite gently upon the haphazard shivers of the ocean – an ocean become all froth and foam from the tear-stricken eyes of sailors exiled within the wrecks under the eddies.We, the Shakespearean Protozoa, drunk with a literary overdose of lysergic acid, turn to face the jaw of the whale within which our Monadic ancestors lie. But even before we are lowered into our boats, we but see fractals folding and frowning at us from the forehead of the whale beyond which our visions collapse. The spout sprays butane and all we see is vapour. Moby-Dick is gas and in search of Thalassa, all of us are Ahabs behind slouched hats, foolishly branded with the stigma of monomania, when we are trying to discover Marina, like lost-Ulysseses become hollow-Prufrocks, exhausted in our drifting-oceanic voyage, all of us seeking a way to evaporate before the spermaceti lanterns extinguish.Surreal.P.S: Apologies, I do not know how to write, for when an Ahab is dragged into the depths and a Pip lost forever and with neither any Starbucks who cherish nor any Stubbs who cheer, all a stupid reader like me can do is float under the black bubble of constant sorrow where I see myself burst.I apologise to the world for the foolishness I am.', ""Got the book for ₹350. It was supposed to take six days, but arrived in two. The packaging was in a hard cardboard box, so the binding and pages were safe in transit. Kudos to Amazon/Seller for choosing to do this rather than the poly bag packaging they sent last time (which sadly ruined the spine of my Wuthering Heights book).As for the book itself, the Oxford World's Classics edition includes a descriptive introduction, a well researched etymology, very helpful explanatory notes with words marked with asterisks in the work itself for references, and most helpfully Melville's personal letters to Hawthorne regarding this book. It makes for a very comprehensive book to own, and I would recommend it to anyone for this price (the MSRP sticker quotes ₹399, so do not pay any more than that for the sellers that have upmarked it for no reason at all, and look at another publishing in this price range!).The cover of it was a bit dirty, but it was most probably due to the age it sat on the shelf than anything else, and there were still no visible signs of any damage on the cover or the pages themselves. As for the seller, I got it from Manav Books and would personally recommend them to another buyer, though your own experience may vary. All in all, I was worried when I ordered due to it being the last one in stock and with it being marked at a third of the price of the next lowest seller, but I got a perfectly good copy of it that lives up to my satisfaction.As for Melville himself, well, the praise you've heard for him is probably less than what he deserves. The prose is utterly brilliant in execution, and the destructive narrative approach with a non-linear approach is somehow made to work really well. I won't comment much on the metaphysical or the alussions or the metaphors or the references (of which have already been made many in my short time reading it!), but trust me the level of care and devotion put into writing it is second to none. I'd suggest this for someone who already has experienced reading Shakespeare's works (especially Macbeth and King Lear, at the minimum), Paradise Lost by John Milton, and old verses of significant literary importance if it be possible.The author expects you to be well-read and highly intellectual. There's a bar of entry into getting into the book and enjoying it to its fullest potential, but for an experienced reader this is a mesmerising experience.Hemingway was wrong: American Literature does not start with Huckleberry Finn; it starts with Moby Dick.PS: The font size is bigger than the font in Penguin's edition of Paradise lost, and the print and paper quality are far better so don't worry on that front."", 'Nothing substantial can be added to glory of the book so I will focus on this particular edition which has original illustrations by Rockwell Kent.

It gets clearer with each passing page that the incident might have far reaching political ramifications, if the murderer is not found.The beauty of this book lies in the way it represents the concept of multiperspectivity. Each chapter in the book is titled after a character in the book, whose perspective is then narrated in the said chapter. This way, most of the major characters in the book are handed the opportunity to present their points of view. This is the book’s way of allowing us to pre-empt who the dreaded murder could be, lurking among those characters.What makes this book even more beautiful is the way we are taken through multiple schools of art, and and a brief glimpse into how each art-form evolved differently from the other.The murderer can only get caught with a deeper understanding of the ""style & signature"" that he employs, and how his painting is different from that of the other suspect miniaturists, who were all taught under the same roof, moulded by their master to bring out similar appearing work.There are also parallel stories within the book that entwine around the hunt for the murderer. As the scheming nature of other characters are laid bare, we can’t help but think, why the murderer alone is being hounded.Even though I went back and forth in the book looking for clues that I might would have missed, I could not be sure of the murderer till the penultimate chapter.As Black (a character in the book puts it) - “Painting is the silence of thought and the music of sight.”']";The Sultan secretly commissions a great book: a celebration of his life and the Ottoman Empire, to be illuminated by the best artists of the day - in the European manner.

Worth a read.', '[There are no spoilers in this review]I normally finish a book once I start it, even if it doesn\'t seem very promising. The only reason I finished this one was that just a couple of weeks ago, I gave up on ""The Salt Path"", and didn\'t want to give up again so soon.Oh dear, though, this book was a long, hard slog. I finish most books within 2-5 days, but this one took me the best part of 3 weeks. I couldn\'t even stay awake to read it, so I began reading it in the afternoons rather than late evening. Rather than write a long, labyrinthine paragraph explaining why (because that\'s what the author would do), below is a list of my main dislikes of this book.Way too clever for its own good. I generally like whodunits, and don\'t mind being in a state of confusion at times, but this story was way too complicated. Especially in the latter third or so, there were so many characters introduced that I couldn\'t remember who was who, and whether someone was a goodie or baddie (indeed, some characters seemed to sway back and forth between being ""good"" and ""bad"".) I ended up almost in a state of learned helplessness, accepting everything that was thrown at me without feeling that I had to go back and figure out who this character is, and what they did earlier in the book.The main character (Smilla) was really unlikable. She seemed like a female character written by a male author, and a male author who, it seemed, doesn\'t like women.Although there wasn\'t much sex in the book, the sexual overtones were a little disturbing. Again, I wonder at the idea of a male author writing from the female perspective. The description of the main character sleeping with the little boy were just creepy.Constantly implausible. Even fiction should be believable. Smilla had so many injuries, it\'s a medical miracle she could even stand up. And in the scenes on the ship it seemed impossible so much was going on, but she didn\'t get ""caught."" The section where she exited a room, only to find people in the gangway, not once, but three times, and just ""disappeared back through the door"" each time without being noticed simply defies belief. Several similar implausible happenings throughout.Way, way too much detail. It\'s not enough for Smilla to enter a room and describe the few most important aspects of what she sees. There is a lengthy, tortuous description of seemingly EVERYTHING that\'s in the room - etc., etc. Even the insightful facts about snow and ice, and Greenland and Denmark were simply boring most of the time. Towards the end, I found myself skip-reading paragraphs because of past experience reading every paragraph carefully, only to realise that much of what I had read was IRRELEVANT to the story.As the blurb about the book says, the story starts with the death of a young boy, and describes over the next 380 pages Smilla\'s almost obsessive drive to solve the reason why he died. To be fair, by the end of the story, the boy\'s death was ""explained"", but the work I had to do in order to reach that point was simply not worth it. I can say with 100% certainty that I won\'t bother reading another of this author\'s books. There is way too much good fiction out there to hope his other books might be better.', 'Firstly, the writing here is exquisite. The story is intriguing, but it’s not the plot that will keep you reading. The mystery around the child’s death is not the driving force of the book, it’s more of a sub-plot for the main character’s existence. The main reason you’ll keep reading is for Smilla. Nothing is missed in her characterisation, and the writer uses language so seamlessly and smoothly that it feels like you know every aspect of her life, fears, hopes and motives.My only (small) complaint is that I felt that I needed a crash course in the history and geography of Denmark’s relationship with Greenland. It’s integral to the character’s personality and actions, and I kept having to google things about Denmark’s colonisation of Greenland. However this didn’t detract from the quality of the story or the writing.']";A little boy falls off a roof in Copenhagen and is killed.

The Plague and the Great Fire of London erased one third of London's population in two successive years. Brooks in her novel portrays the role of women, and the ways to survive amidst the pandemic.This is a magnificent novel.However, I got a book with yellowed pages with pencil markings, which I do not like anyhow.Keep reading. Keep engage in getting the orgasmes of the pleasures of reading a text."", '‘Year of Wonders’ tells the tale of Anna Frith, a young woman living in the village of Eyam, Derbyshire, during an outbreak of the plague (The Black Death).  It’s supposed to be based on true events; the villagers really did decide to quarantine themselves (under the guidance of their rector, the Reverend William Mompesson) and stayed this way for just over a year whilst the disease swept through the village, wiping out entire families and decimating the population as a whole.  The problem is, but for a few character’s names which remain the same, Brooks has taken it upon herself to change almost every aspect of the real events, leaving a hollow, disappointing novel about nothing much in particular.My main problem with the novel was Anna herself.  She’s quite literally everywhere, from witnessing the first death, tending to virtually every single one of the sick and dying – including her own children – acting as an impromptu midwife and the most unbelievable role of all, working down a mine!  She’s the 17th century equivalent of Wonder Woman and it just doesn’t ring true.  Someone in her position – uneducated and from a poor family – would not have been able to do half the things she does without an education, money or social standing to support her, even if she is thought of as inquisitive and ‘unusually intelligent’.  Yet despite all of this we’re meant to believe that she learns to read in English AND Latin, picks up the rudimentary elements of midwifery and is able to logically question the progression of the plague from a scientific (for the times) viewpoint.  Nope sorry, it just doesn’t fly with this reader.Then there’s Michael Mompellion – presumably Brooks’ fictionalised version of the real-life William Mompesson – who’s written as nothing more than the characteristic troubled religious man, harbouring a dark secret.  The problem is, the real Mompesson was nothing like his fictional character and it’s an insult to his memory for Brooks to portray him in this way.  Were it not for Mompesson’s forward-thinking proposition and the devotion of his parishioners, the village of Eyam and many of the surrounding villages would certainly have been decimated by the plague.  But Brooks has simplified this character to such a degree that there are no grey areas.  He swings from good to bad, zealot to disbeliever, with no layers in-between, making for a wholly unlikeable character who, if he were actually based on the real Mompesson, would have struggled to find anyone devoted enough to listen to him, never mind following his instruction when it came to the quarantine.I understand it’s fiction and as such, writers can afford to stretch the truth a little even when writing a fiction novel based on fact.  But to completely change a person’s character to suit your story, says a lot to me about how invested the author was in portraying this genuinely interesting historical event and the people involved.  And in the case of Brooks’ ‘Year of Wonders’ it would appear she wasn’t interested in the slightest, bypassing the facts in favour of her increasingly ridiculous storylines.Essentially what this turns into is a ludicrous historical romance novel, with the occasional bodice-ripping moment sprinkled in, presumably to help spice things up a bit as there’s certainly no real drama or suspense found elsewhere in the novel.  There’s no sense of the desperation the villagers must have felt when faced with the reality of the quarantine and as for the poor people who contract the plague and subsequently die, Brooks reels them off like the credits at the end of a bad film.  We never get close enough to them or their stories because it’s ostensibly all about Anna and as a result, it’s difficult to care about any of them or share in their loved ones’ grief when another person passes away.  In reality these people’s lives were a living hell, with one resident – Elizabeth Hancock – burying her six children and her husband in the span of eight days, just one of the many heart-breaking examples.I didn’t reach the end – it all got far too unbelievable and frustrating for me – but reading other reviews online, I understand that the ending is farcical to say the least which doesn’t surprise me given the first 3/4 of the novel.  Whilst I’ve no doubt that Brooks is a successful writer – she won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel ‘March’ so she must be doing something right – ‘Year of Wonders’ is so full of absurd ideas and downright unbelievable story arcs, it’s almost possible to convince yourself it’s been written by someone else who just happens to have the same name.  Mind you, I’ve not read any of Brooks’ other novels, so perhaps they are all like this…?', ""It's curious how, under a mass Covid-19 clampdown, parallels emerge to earlier art or much earlier history: think of the mayor in “Jaws”, doing his best to dissuade the Chief of Police and others from closing the beach – the locality is safe, no giant sharks – because he's more concerned about financial prosperity, and compare such action with the attitudes of leaders of some governments regarding Cvd19.  In contrast to that, look at how, under responsible leadership in the seventeenth century, a voluntary quarantine helped quell the spread of a virulent outbreak and prevent epidemic from ravaging its region.Just about everyone from the Peak District, Derbyshire and its neighbouring counties has heard the story of bubonic plague striking Eyam and the villagers' self-imposed quarantine.  Here's a view of it from somebody from well beyond the area, adeptly expressed as first-person account from one of the survivors, and it's interesting to read this through the glass of a partial quarantine imposed nationally 3½ centuries later. Some of the names are genuine, notably the first victim and the retired minister, but some are deliberately made up.  For instance, the authoress has changed the character of the village's rector and his wife, where she wants to tell a different story (although much of it consistent with the real rector's actions).  Curiously, the name of the afflicted village is not mentioned (everyone knows what it is) but its location is given accurately in relation to other villages and towns nearby.Geraldine Brooks casts her narratress as a young woman of humble station, who is astute, determined and shrewd and learns well and quickly.  (Of course, as an articulate writer herself, she has to do this so as to make the characterization feasible.)  Thus she creates a narrative framework for life under the Plague (and life under lockdown – of a sort), and a close observer of the different characters which emerge with it.  The disease emerges slowly in the village and nobody really takes it seriously to begin with.  The infection hibernates though, and when the weather changes, the Plague strikes, and devastates.  Time and again we see how all families of all characters suffer and the population continues to decline.  Under the stress and fear, personal rivalries and resentments and mediæval superstitions are all accentuated.There's also quite a long central section, where the life of the 17th Century Peak District inhabitants is described.  There's an engrossing, if brief, account of the lead mining which was the area's economic mainstay around that time, other than farming.  Geraldine Brooks has a year to fill in this narrative, so she wants to give it some substance, not mere padding. This all works effectively, so even if some events are not documented in the village's history, the episodes in the narrative are quite plausible.  Mind you, in all this and its textured variety, the men are either simple or wicked (sometimes both) and some of the women too, but it's only the female characters who show kindness or intelligence.  Let's not dwell too long on this cheap, puerile misadrony, as the whole thing is put together well, although it is disappointing to see the rector's nature and achievement tainted or diminished in her revision to actual events; it's pointless and is the one thing in the novel which doesn't ring true.It's a notable effort from somebody not even from the same country, let alone county.  The authoress, having developed a career as a social historienne and journalist, must be accustomed to the leg-work of research and investigation and seems to have done a good deal.  Her narratress uses old English or possibly regional dialect terms, which help give a sense of character, place and community.  Their use is sparing though, so we can glean the meaning from the context.  (Perhaps she's been especially witty and just made them up!  I doubt it though, but it would be quite funny.)  Rather than reading a version from a Peak District writer (proclaiming the heroism of the ancestors) it's in some ways a bit more gratifying that an outsider with no previous knowledge of the events has chosen this episode in English history around which to craft, with a largely accurate historical basis, such an entertaining and instructive novel.""]";From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of 'March' and 'People of the Book'.

To top it off there is some sort of rivalry between the MCs not Vamp boyfriend and the freaky vamp author. MacAlister makes it seem as though they have a history which led me to believe the the MCs boyfriend knew way more than he was letting on and was actually a vampire.

So much so that she somewhat neglects her duties as a mother to young Augusten. But all is well because she realises that she can in fact send her son to live with her shrink, Dr Finch. And this would be fine were it not for the fact that Finch is more insane than she is.Faking a suicide attempt that allows Augusten to drop out of school (a plot designed by Finch), the boy lives a life of freedom with his new family, embarking on a series of strange events that will ultimately lead him to discovering who he is and what he wants to do with his life.This book is hilarious. Augusten's adventures are so funny that I laughed out loud many times, something I rarely do when reading. Whether it be pulling down the ceiling of the kitchen because he thinks a skylight is needed or, aged thirteen, dating his step brother Neil (who is in his thirties) you can't help but laugh at the humour injected into what could have been severely damaging experiences.There's a memorable cast of characters including a grinning Hispanic who wants to be his new father, his sisters Hope and Natalie with whom he forges strong and poignant bonds, little Poo so named because he does poos everywhere, Dr Finch himself who thinks nothing of dishing out trial medicines seemingly without thought and who believes messages can be read in human turds, and his mother who swings from poetic flights of fancy to full blown psychotic episodes. But most memorable of all is Augusten. Chain smoking at thirteen, with dreams of establishing a hair product empire, you read this book with what I guess is some sort of strange envy. His life, though messed up, is bohemian and carefree and whatever comes along he just grabs without thinking. He's irresponsible, bratty and bitchy but he's also caring and kind, and it's his heart that lets you invest in the book.If you're looking for funny and strange memoirs, edged with pathos, then Running With Scissors is the book for you."", ""My search for the El dorado of memoir / autobiographies ends here,This book should have been delivered on silk cushion followed by incense burning and lit candles.If like me you rate the memoir on an open candid story, well this is as open as walking in public without underwear and the crotch of your jeans removed.This is the real life version of an Irvine Welsh story, disturbingly funny, outrageously dysfunctional and totally addictive, if you're easily offended read the book, if your not easily offended read the book, JUST READ THIS BOOK!!""]";The #1 New York Times BestsellerAn Entertainment Weekly Top Ten Book of the YearNow a Major Motion PictureRunning with Scissors is the true story of a boy whose mother (a poet with delusions of Anne Sexton) gave him away to be raised by her unorthodox psychiatrist who bore a striking resemblance to Santa Claus.

The compression involved occasioning so many nuances and so much unstated meaning is at the very heart of this claustrophobic piece. In so many subtle ways Edith Wharton ratchets up the tension, without once stepping away from the restraint and delicacy of her characteristic style. So much of great literature, especially prose has as its central concern the struggle between the individual and the forces, social and psychological, that choke possibilities of living to the full.

The F-8 Crusader's history in this war is not as well known or as well covered in the media as the F-4 Phantom, and I'm so glad that CDR Nichols took the time to write this book before he passed away so it would never be lost.  Thank you sir!By the way, this book is in desperate need of a new edition.  I first bought the paperback version which has the blue cover and it is a digitized copy of the 1987 first edition from the collections of the University of Michigan Library.  This digitized copy is newly printed on demand when you order it, so what you get is a book that is new, but looks very old because of the source copy.  The 20 black and white photos in the center of the book are also a little dark and fuzzy because of this digitization.I later purchased an out of print hardcover edition of this book and it was much better than the digitized blue paperback.  The printing on the page looked better, the photos in the center were brighter and sharper, and because I bought it used it cost a lot less!This book is definitely worth owning and reading and I highly recommend picking up an out of print hardcover, especially if you can find one in good shape and at a decent price.

Coauthors John Nichols, a fighter pilot in the war, and Barrett Tillman, an award-winning aviation historian, make full use of their extensive knowledge of the subject to detail the ways in which airpower was employed in the years prior to the fall of Saigon. Confronting the conventional belief that airpower failed in Vietnam, they show that when applied correctly, airpower was effective, but because it was often misunderstood and misapplied, the end results were catastrophic.

Well if you are interested in a mystery, just like me, then surely such a title will intrigue you. So when I came across this title “A murder on Malabar Hill – Perveen Mistry Investigates” by Sujata Massey, I could not help myself.This Novel “A murder on Malabar Hill” is the first of the Praveen Mistry Investigates series of Novels. Praveen Mistry, the protagonist of the Novel is the first women Solicitor of Bombay and she works along with her father, Jamshedji Mistry, in their Law firm – Mistry Law. One day she is asked by her father to study the will of a client Omar Farid who had died recently; Omar Farid owned a textile mill and lived with his 3 wives and children in a bungalow on Malabar hill. In the will, she comes across a provision which raises her suspicion about all the three widows being duped of their inheritance. She fears that the widows, who are living a life of Seclusion or Parda, might not be aware of this. So she decides to investigate. Her investigation raises the tension in the household , leading to murder. As she continues her investigation, she also finds that her own life is in danger. Want to find what happens next? Well for that you would have to read this novel. The story also takes us to the turbulent past of Perveen’s life, which is very touching and inspiring.This Novel is set in the between 1917-1921 (Indian pre-independence era) and gives us a great view of that time period. The novel gives us an vivid insight into way of life of the people in India during that era When I was reading this book I virtually saw myself living in that era. The Protagonist of the Novel Perveen’s Character is inspired by India’s earliest Women Lawyers Cornelia Sorabji of Pune, who was the first woman to attend Oxford Law School and sit in the British Law exam in 1892 and also by Mithan Tata Lam of Bombay (now Mumbai), who also attended Oxford and was the first woman lawyer to be admitted to the Bombay Bar in 1923. Now this is a great trivia offered by this book, isn’t it?What I liked about the novel is: it kept me hooked and also made me wonder what’s going to happen next. It also took me into an era which gave a sneak peak of what India was and how Indians lived during that time.The only one Put Down of the Novel was in the middle where Perveen explains the details of the will to the widows. The details could have been summarized better, which would have done good to the pace of the book.Except for this, it made a good read and I do recommend it if you like mysteries.']";Bombay, 1921.

And on this special occasion, I'd like to pen a review piece about one of her not so popular book, A Long Fatal Love Chase which is targeted for mature audience and was written before her literary success for the books like Little Women, Little Men, Eight Cousins etc.. Although this particular book has not been widely read or loved by the readers, but I would like to notify such readers to not to judge the book harshly as this when she wrote this book, this young writer was on the road to financially support her family and did not even begin her writing career professionally at that time.Synopsis:Rosamond Vivian, brought up on a remote island by an indifferent grandfather, swears she'd sell her soul to Satan for a year of freedom. When Philip Tempest enters her life, she is ripe for the plucking, but is soon caught up in a web of intrigue, cruelty and deceit stretching back far into the past. Remarkable for its portrayal of a sensual, spirited Victorian heroine, Louisa May Alcott's work, too shocking to be published during her lifetime, tells a compulsive tale of love, desire and deceit. Its publication more than a century after being written marks a new page in literary history.Rosamond Vivian is a charming, innocent and love-sick eighteen year old teenage orphan living with her cynical and mediocre grandfather in a small and remote island off the coast of England. Soon a handsome stranger sweeps her away with his promise of love and marital vows. Enter, Phillip Tempest, an old, mature and impossibly good-looking stranger with a yacht has arrived on the very same island where Rosamond lives with her grandfather. Within an instant, young Rosamond falls for the old, delectable man who speaks of a glittering future with hope, love and extravagance. Within a few days, Philip and Rosamond gets married and sets sail across the ocean. And after their journey, they settle up in a countryside town in Nice, along with a man-servant named, Baptiste and a child servant, Ippolito. Little did beautiful, naive and newly married Rosamond that her marital life is set up on lies and deceit that finally forces the young woman to escape the wretched life and that is when the great chase begins across the whole Europe from Italy to France to Germany, until death soars up across the feet of Rosamond.This great book is perfect for those readers who love to read about Gothic love stories as well as highly thrilling romantic tales and that too with a touch of violence, darkness and fear. The author here explores the darkness of a human nature as well as relationships that are tied with marital vows. The book is interesting enough as each chapter ends with a cliffhanger that begs its readers to keep turning the pages of this book till the very end. The story is both beautiful and dark at the same time and only an author like Alcott could possibly achieve that with equal intensity. Hence the more the book allures, the more it will terrify.The writing of this amazing author is so brilliant and striking that the readers are bound to feel the underlying mood of the story line. The narrative is equally engaging although it rarely falters from its own flow and misdirects towards boredom. The readers, no matter what, will be able to find the dialogues comprehensible enough to make them feel for the characters' ongoing plight. The pacing is really swift as there are chase scenes penned with extreme thrill and suspense that will soar the temperature of the readers while reading about the young woman's journey from one country to another.The mystery concocted by the author is tightly wrapped under layers of twists that will only increase tension and anticipation of the readers. Reading this story will make the readers feel like riding high on a roller coaster ride that is filled with adrenaline rushing scenes, exciting and equally terrifying moments and lots of baffling challenges. The story will grip the readers right from the very beginning with its intensity of sweetness but then scares the hell out of the readers' mind when the chase begins.The characters are very poorly crafted hence the readers will struggle to see beyond the characters and into their deepest core and that's the only disappointment I've while reading this book. In a nutshell, this is a riveting love story that is horrifying and equally compassionate enough to make the readers feel the bridge between the two."", 'Boring given up after 3 chapters.', 'good']";"""I'd gladly sell my soul to Satan for a year of freedom,"" cries impetuous Rosamond Vivian to her callous grandfather.

A huge thanks to whoever sent this one my way :) since I received the book so long ago that have totally forgotten who gifted me :) apologies and thanks from the bottom of my heart. Now that I have finished my first Binchy :) I\'ve got to make a list of her best works and pick them up in my next haul (sometime in next 6 months depending how long my current stock lasts). Surprisingly Maeve Binchy\'s writing is totally my cup of tea, straight forward, no hard hitting words, flawless writing, totally life like and believable characters with their own set of struggles, aspirations, dreams and desires for which at times some of them betray the same people who in turn totally love them and still keep their faith on them. The story has so much heart in it that it made big time emotional, gave me so many lumps in my throat but it equally inspired, made me smile as well as made me laugh quite a few times. On top of that my search just returned me an amazing result that a movie was made on the same with Andy McDowell playing one of the lead characters with the same guy who played Sir Jorah Mormont in much loved Game of Thrones TV series :) tempting me big time to get hold of the movie and watch it tonight.As the title suggests ""Tara Road"" is the story of one posh locality from Dublin (Ireland) where the lead pair of Danny Lynch and his amazing wife Ria (Maria) make their home. How that get that house and how heavenly she turns it out with some amazing set of friends, relatives and neighbors which always kept the reader in me all delighted. But not everything remains always as good as we expect them to be and Binchy hit me hard with that unexpected twist, giving another set of amazing characters from thousands of miles away who gets in touch with Ria out of sheer co-incidence and they end up doing a house exchange for two months, both recovering from their own set of set-backs. How they help each other from miles away, never have met and with no clue about each other\'s lives makes up for an amazing cliff hanger story with so much going around that I just couldn\'t resist and end up reading the whole 600+ pages as fast as I could to get to the end :). Author has done an amazing job of showing two poles apart cultures from Ireland and United States in such an amazing way that it adds up so much value to the whole narrative. It indeed was so amazing to grasp that how different yet how same we all are, wherever we may be living. Ria and Danny\'s cute kids especially Brian the younger one who is always annoying his teenage sister make up for two super entertaining characters with their own set of problems. You\'ve got to read this wholesome family entertainer as I kept updating my own teenage daughter and wifey with the going on story that I was loving big time.As I mentioned earlier this is my first Binchy book but I must say she has a mastery on relationships. This was one superb example of Husband Wife relationship, how different we all are. A perfect story for Father Son and Sibling chemistry (or rivalry). Mother Daughter relationship (two sets) totally amazed me especially the ease with which the story develops and how the characters are carved out and handled, loved it. I have read a lot of books in the recent few years but none comes any close to this one when it comes to talking about depths in relationships, trust, love and even betrayal too. Unbelievably amazing this story is and like I said totally life like.Unfortunately I had no idea of Binchy\'s writing but I must say she is one heck of a writer. I guess I read it at the right time as it has given me some terrific food for my thoughts on teenage life and how to handle them (or set them free). If you have read Tara Road or seen the movie version, do let me know how you liked it :) and if you haven\'t read this one, I suggest you take a break and grab it ASAP. Also, do let me know if you have a favorite Binchy, I would love to lay my hands on it at the earliest.', ""Nobody can tell a story like Maeve Binchy. All her books are wonderful but Tara Road just has the edge for me. The life of Ria & Danny, along with the family & friends that pass through Tara Road daily, is told beautifully & at times achingly hard to absorb. It is too real, too close to home, but that's what is expected from every Maeve Binchy book. They aren't all happy ever after, what they are, are true to life, searingly funny & honest tales with flawed & lovely characters. Some awful ones thrown in too! Read every Maeve Binchy book and once you read them, tell everyone to read them! She was a once in a lifetime author, my favourite Irish writer."", ""Good enough to keep reading, but would not recommend. Too many ill-defined characters that served no useful purpose to the repetitive plot. When some were mentioned, I kept thinking, who's that?! Even by the end of the book.  Too many sub plots, mainly around Danny's affairs, that didn't reach a satisfactory conclusion. In fact, the ending was a let-down, a damp squib, which left me saying, 'yes, but what about . . . And what about .  . .?'It was more as if Binchy thought, well, let's draw a veil over all the betrayals, and make a nice cosy ending.""]";A house swap leads to an unlikely and touching friendship, as secrets are unveiled and lives changed.Ria and Marilyn have never met - they live thousands of miles apart, separated by the Atlantic Ocean: one in a big, warm, Victorian house in Tara Road, Dublin, the other in a modern, open-plan house in New England. Two more unlikely friends would be hard to find: Ria's life revolves around her family and friends, while Marilyn's reserve is born of grief. But when each needs a place to escape to, a house exchange seems the ideal solution.Along with the borrowed houses come

It marked me profoundly; I\'m approaching 50 now and only just been able to read it again.Great book, but a harsh story, not easy to stomach if you like animals.  Supposed to be an adventure story, and yes it is.  But the backdrop is about vivisection and generally how animals are treat badly by humans.  (To be fair, the author acknowledges through one of the dog characters that people ""probably treat each other badly, too"".)Enjoyable as a well-written book (and yes an exciting adventure story); nothing like Watership Down, and definitely not for kids.The first time I read it I was surprised and delighted by the happy ending because from the rest of the book I couldn\'t see how this would end well.  How naive was I?  When planning to re-read the book I did a bit of \'reading around\' and I found out that wasn\'t the original ending - the original idea was to end it after the dogs \'escape\' from the beach.

It was a wonderful hardback - the illustrations of the Lake District by the late Alfred Wainwright complimented Adams' rich, vivid prose perfectly. Sadly though, the illustrations have been removed from this recent (2015) re-issue, hence why this book loses a star in my estimation. The story itself remains unaltered, and it's as good as it's ever been.The Plague Dogs is a simple tale as its core, treading the fine line between fact and fantasy, but it's certainly not a kid's book - there's too much hard swearing and gory imagery to recommend it for such audiences.

But since the story is told from Wharton's point of view - and to make things worse, not always in the first person - there is no telling where reason merges into madness.Will Self's portrayal of insanity is overwhelming. His style of writing is explosive. But the reader might as well be warned about a few things. First, madness is more boring than it sounds. Obsession is by definition repetitive, and My Idea Of Fun is too long in parts. Second, Will Self is either less good at, or not interested in, doing normality. Example, from an office scene: 'There are no such things as strangers, only prospects we haven't converted, yet.' Business people don't talk like that, not informally. And does everyone have to be a sexually tormented freak? Perhaps the point is that there is no such thing as normality, that we are all insane to a degree. If so, it is made neither subtly nor convincingly. Third, the novel's ending is predictably cryptic, with at least three plausible interpretations. There is a point to this, of course, but some readers do like to have closure. This book is only fun if you're prepared to go a little cuckoo over it."", ""But if you don't like him you will hate it.  I had an argument with a friend of a friend about it - his view was that Self is pompous and likes to show off his knowledge.  My view is that he just thinks and therefore writes at a level which requires concentration and doesn't spoon-feed the reader. Not an agreeable read, certainly - the central character is not remotely appealing.  But it is a very good book."", ""Intriguing for a while; but then I got the feeling that the author was making it up as he went along, thrying to give the impression of great depth when there really was none,  Then again, maybe I don't recognize depth when I see it.  Who knows?""]";When the young Ian Wharton first meets Mr Broadhurst, he is completely unaware of the influence he will come to exert over his life as ' The Fat Controller' - a constant companion and confidant and also the obese, erudite manifestation of Ian' s mental illness. As Ian' s idea of fun becomes increasingly extreme, the reader is taken to a place where morality is eroded by the dull grind of modernity and everything becomes admissable.  Read more

They are both long and highly complex, written not as a novel as such but to transmit a message, in this case, the similarities between the Faustus legend and the rise of Nazi Germany.  However, I have been fortunate to read both this book and another major work of Mann, The Magic Mountain, in new translations by John E Woods which bring a clear and smooth passage through these undoubtedly great works of literature.Dr Faustus is on the face of it, a fictional biography of Adrian Leverkuhn, a brilliant composer who came to fame in the 1920s and 30s.  The biography is recorded by his life-long friend Dr Serenus Leitblom, who happens to have possession of Leverkuhn's journals including a secret manuscript, which comes to light about half way through the book, which gives an account of the terrible evening when Leverkuhn entered into a pact with the devil, to exchange his soul for 24 years of brilliant musical composition.Dr Leitblom has a hard time of it with Adrian Leverkuhn, the friendship never achieving an easy  intimacy, and several times there are references to Leverkuhn's refusal to use the personal pronoun with even his closest associates.  He is unapproachable and isolated, and takes private rooms in a farmhouse, some distance from Munich. His almost hermit-like existence is relieved by train journeys into the city where he takes part in musical and philosophical soirees, described in some detail by Mann and showing his command of the most complex musical ideas.Leverkuhn's music is rarely well-received, being appreciated by only a select band of critics, the message being that it is too rarified for the common concert-goer, but will eventually be vindicated by generations to come. The implication is that only listeners similarly in league with the devil would be able to appreciate its complex abstractions.Dr Leitblom writes his biography during the dark days of 1944 when Germany's collapse was seen as inevitable, and the tragic destiny of Leverkuhn is contrasted with occasional short accounts of the unfolding disasters caused by allied bombing of the great cities of Germany and the breaches of its borders by invading armies.  This gives the whole book an atmosphere of burning cities and the inevitable doom which awaits Leverkuhn all who sup at the devil's table, the final chapter being a revelatory denouement which shows the dark forces which have worked through Leverkuhn's music throughout his life.By the time Mann wrote this book he was living in America and broadcasting radio messages into Germany criticizing the Nazi regime.  Dr Faustus is in some ways Mann's ultimate critique of Nazism, something he had been fighting since its first appearance in the 1920s.  Dr Faustus is not an easy read, far from it, but it is an important element of world literature and great piece of art in its own right which can only enrich the reader who perseveres with it."", ""I really enjoyed reading this book slowly from cover to cover. It can be enjoyed on many levels which makes it accessible for readers of many different backgrounds. I enjoyed it first as a very convincing fictional biography of an early-twentieth century German composer. I later discovered the book's potential to be read as an allegory for Germany's shift to Nazism.I think the beauty of the writing lies in the way in which Thomas Mann chooses to convey deep psychological truth not through long impenetrable sentences filled with complex vocabulary but with telling descriptions of the nuances in his characters' appearance and physical mannerisms. I find this more 'everyday' language far more enjoyable to read and, for the most part, more effective in conveying meaning.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about German history, German music or anyone who simply wants to be told a good story in sophisticated but not stifling language."", 'I wrote my BA dissertation on Doctor Faustus and I love Thomas Mann’s work. I’m looking forward to reading the new translation. I am disappointed that the book arrived damaged. I dare say it’ll get a bit battered by me over time, but I would have liked it to have been pristine when I received it.']";Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told By A Friend (Vintage International) is a story about a German music composer, Adrian Leverkuhn. The book discusses everything about Adrian's life starting from his childhood, to his extremely successful career, to his tragic death. He was born in the early 20th century and in his determination to become the greatest musician of his time, he trades his soul to the devil in exchange for 24 years of success and prosperity as a music composer. Adrian loses his ability to be humane and becomes incapable of love. He

It was also a revelation that the commercial activities of the Netherlands at that time were considerably more valuable to the Spanish occupants than all the gold and silver they got from their empire in the Americas.The book is educational in the best of ways, by making the reader want to learn more about the painter and his art, as well as the historical events of the time and art in general, but it's also very funny and unputdownable."", ""One of the best books I have read. I have to say that I read it using a kindle, making frequent detours to click on names and topics (nominalism, iconology, iconography). It was an education. Frayne opened my eyes to a period in History that was not something I knew. As someone who lived briefly in the Netherlands, I am ashamed of how ignorant I was of this traumatic period in their history. The evils of the Spanish occupation and comparisons to Nazi occupied Netherlands really emphasised the traumas that the Netherlandish peoples have been through, thanks to the Roman Catholic Church and later the ideology of the former Catholic Mr Hitler.This was a book that is also very funny. If you have met people like Tony Churt, it makes it all the more fun. Laura is another fascinating character, so real in ones mind's eye. Met many of her type as well.

The author, who portrays himself as a good-natured bumbler, stumbles into the opportunity to travel to a small island in this remote country and enact some scheme for the betterment of the islanders. Once there, he eventually stumbles on the idea of a chicken business; then follows a long but ultimately successful quest to obtain the necessary chickens. Meanwhile he enjoys the pace and beauty of island life and the company of both islanders and expats.And there’s not too much else to say about this one: it’s enjoyable, but not particularly insightful; we don’t learn too much either about the islands or the author. When Randall questioned the veracity of Arthur Grimble’s memoir of Pacific island life (which I also recently read), I started to wonder about Randall’s own honesty. A few episodes seem very neat, and really, who loses his footing and falls headlong into a bush or a pile of sacks every time he gives a speech? Once I could believe, but twice? Nevertheless, this is a nice lightweight read and helped fill in the Solomon Islands on my mental map.

Well, I was not too impressed. Not entirely disappointed either. It was refreshing to read conversations in pidgin English and read descriptions of Honiara and Munda (though I disagree that Honiara is a horrible place). What I was hoping for was more closure to the story and more lessons learned as a volunteer. It sounds like Will had a good experience with his chicken project and the follow up restaurant, but what became of these ventures? I, for one, don\'t remember Chicken Willie\'s in Munda when I was there in 2009, but perhaps I missed it. I don\'t know how I could have, but perhaps...Some of the descriptions are quite contrived, too. I love a good descriptive travel narrative, and if your job is to describe the Solomon Islands, you\'d better be ready. It is a brilliant place with more colors than anywhere else in the world. His description of the chicken crowing and the sun coming up like a big fiery disc... blah blah blah... was just not up to par with how other travel writers could have dealt with it. I\'m a fan of Theroux and Bryson, so perhaps I was expecting too much.The book also reads like a choppy set of chapters all thrown together with little links between them. There is a story, but it runs as an undercurrent to different self-contained chapters. I found this to be a little annoying, especially considering the fact that the main story doesn\'t really conclude itself.

This story hugely focuses on the concept of death and life, of redemption and resurrection. Taking place in two cites; Paris and London at a time when the people were living under the kings like petty insects with a thirst for revenge rising in their midst. Dark secrets brewing behind the rising blood of the French Revolution, we get an in depth view of the state of the common innocent people who got stuck in between this bloodbath.The story opens by describing the situations in France and England as Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a respectable banker of the Tellson\'s Bank, a businessman through and through is on his way from London to Dover where nobody trusts anybody. They are stopped by a messenger looking for Mr. Lorry, who returns the message he received by sending his own, ""Recalled to Life"" And thus, the idea of resurrection began.This tale doesn\'t just draws us in the lives of these characters which have been woven and knitted so delicately it also gives us an understanding on the human nature. It shows us how the thirst for revenge can turn into the reason why the revenge was seeked. Madame Defarge, a very important character in this book is shown to be silently knitting all the time, but keenly hears and sees everything happening around her. The knitting she does is a very important aspect of the story. Dickens tries to throw this back to the Fates in the Greek Mythology, where the three fates knit the fates of people and when a person is to die they cut off a string. The same way Madame Defarge keeps knitting with all of her sisterhood the fates of the people she believes has done wrong to her and her beloved. She wants to damn a whole family and see them dead even if not all of the are guilty. Her thirst for revenge grows so much that she wants to vanquish the line altogether.""The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.""The wine here represents the blood of all those innocents upon whose back the French aristocrats built their lives. It foreshadows to when the people of France would rise up as one and turn the tables against said aristocrats.The three main characters in this story that draw all the strings of the tapestry together are; Lucie Manette, daughter of a doctor who was unfairly put into the Bastille for 18 years to be forgotten is seventeen when introduced in the year 1775. She has always thought herself an orphan until Mr. Lorry, an old friend of Dr. Manette tells her that her father is alive and is at the residence of the Defarges who had been in service to the doctor a long time ago. Hearing this Lucie and Mr. Lorry go and find Dr. Manette in a state where he doesn\'t even remember his name. All he knows now is the name of his cell and to make shoes. They find him bent over his work with barely any light coming through. He is not in a fit state of mind and neither Mr. Lorry nor Defarge, the wine seller and husband to Mrs. Defarge can get anything out of him. But when he sees Lucie he stops working and actually looks at her. Her presence calms him and recalls him to life. They go back to England with Mr. Lorry as their escort where they live in a small house in Soho.The story reopens five years hence with the love interest, Charles Darney who is being wrongly accused of treason in England. Charles Darney\'s biggest secret plays a huge part in the story as he is part of a family of French aristocrats, the same family that had been responsible for Dr. Manette\'s long imprisonment. Sydney Carton, the brilliant yer dissolute alcoholic English lawyer gets Charles aquitted.Onto, the third character who plays a highly important role we are introduced to a young Englishman; Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton\'s character is one of the most complex one. He is in love with Lucie Manette who he knows he can\'t have so he makes a pact to keep her and all those she loves safe. All through the book Sydney thinks of himself as a damned soul and looks for redemption.""To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.""This pretty much summaries the condition of both the cities during the time of when the book takes place. Everything looks good when you see it from afar but when you look closely you just realise how wrong the world truly is.""I tell thee,"" said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, ""that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing.""This has been said by Mrs. Defarge and shows the readers how muchthe thirst for revenge can destroy a person from within. That once this fire starts it is next to impossible to ever stop it. It just wants more and more. It always keeps advancing, always keeps growing. This is a way for the author to warn us against going down this road.""It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued""This represents how the seeked peace but could never could quit grab onto it because it always seemed just out of reach. Mankind has always been prone to destruction and this is no different. To achieve absolute peace is just an idealist though and not a realistic one.""For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.""This quote describes how Lucie Manette, was feeling the brewing of a storm that was to strike soon on her happy life with her family. The echoing footsteps she heard, of the danger to come would disturb her greatly even though her life was well and good until then.""Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning""The answer for violence is never violence and the answer for death isn\'t death because the French Revolution had taken a turn and a sharp female, newly-born called La Guillotine had arrived and a new kind of bloodshed had started in which Lucie and her dear family got stuck without having done any wrong.""For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.""The story is so incredibly woven together that you won\'t understand everything until the very end when it will all come to sense. Charles Dickens has a fascinating wat of story telling that it puts you in the same place as the characters and makes you live the story. You can feel the grief and the pain of what the characters are going through and the poetic writing style wants you to never leave the book alone. And nothing but a quote from this book itself can represent how I felt reading it:""No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.""', ""The book is a treasure for readers.

You are left numb with emotional stasis at the end.', 'My 3rd reading of this masterpiece written with irony and finesse. The eternal story of Emma Bovary and her broken dreams is heartbreaking every time.The narration is actually quite modern in that the perspective changes quite often from a mysterious first person in the beginning (a schoolmate of Charles Bovary?) to the interior monologues of Charles, Emma, Léon, and Rodolphe. The descriptions of the various locations in the book are always surprising with tiny references to the principle characters. It may surprise you to know that this book, which is essentially a tragedy, also is full of humor and sarcasm. For example, when Léon and Emma have a rendez-vous in the Cathedral of Rouen, the Swiss guard who tries to give them a tour of the church while Léon is freaking out and wants to get out of there while Emma pretends to be interested because she is not quite sold on the seduction is pure genius. In a similar, if more romantic vein, the whispered conversation of Rodolphe and Emma in the lodge as the vice-Prefect gives the world\'s most boring speech (his boss couldn\'t be bothered to come) was extraordinary. Every word in Flaubert is measured and perfectly weighted to each situation, the original French is absolutely splendid - whether he is describing the pretentious conversation of M. Homais or the various season and their impact on the moods of the characters and tone of the novel. The only criticism that I can bring is that the denouement is a bit long - that being said, there is another fantastic ironic payoff in the last sentence.This book from 1856 is of course a product of the Romantic period in culture but it surpasses most of its contemporaries by its precise psychology - both of men and women, its irony, its subtle criticism of the ""petit bourgeois"" and French society, and the meticulous observation of detail. Even 161 years later, it remains a monument of literature and a summit of free expression (Flaubert was pursued in court and beat the censors.)', ""Edition is fine. Good printing, haven't read it yet, so no comments about the translation.

It also fills on so many important details which are skipped in the movie (understandably due to duration), but some events were outright changed in movies, which was unnecessary. Also, also the Triwizard tournament in movies was kinda dull, in the book it's thrilling and fun. But why even bother with the goblet and tournament just for Harry to touch the Portkey. Crouch (as Moody) could have enchanted any object which would have taken Harry to the graveyard. Why wait for an entire year! Also, do Portkeys travel along with the traveller to the destination?

It is about the mysteries and adventures of a young boy, named Harry Potter. He has a historical past, and he needs to fight the most evil person of all times, Lord Voldemort.Introduction to this book- Harry's scar is hurting and he has a strange dream. He gathers with the Weasleys to watch the QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, but The Dark Mark apears to be there. Has Voldemort returned? Well, when the scar hurt, he wrote to Sirius Black, and his reply came back saying, he is coming to Harry. Harry becomes worried, he does not want Sirius go back to Azkaban. He says he was half sleeping when he wrote to him. A news appears. The Triwizard tournament is to be held. In this, The three wizarding schools gather together , and a Goblet with blue fires, known as The Goblet of fire, selects three students from each school, to represent themselves. The champions face deadly tasks, which can lead them to Death. Goblet of fire selects a Girl called Fleur Delacour from Beaxbautons school, Viktor Krum , international Quidditch seeker from Durmstrang, Cedric Diggory, Hufflepuff captain of quidditch and seeker for Hogwarts. However, one more champion is selected from Hogwarts. Of course, Harry Potter. Harry swears that he didn't put his name in the goblet, but no one believes, not even Ron. There are 3 tasks. Hagrid manages to tell Harry the first task, which is to fight Dragons. Harry tells Cedric. He was Hogwarts champion, too. Their new defence against the dark arts teacher, Alastor Moody, a retired Auror advices Harry something. Hermione and Harry practice the Summoning charm, and Harry summons his firebolt. Harry wins the first task, but there are 2 more. Ron, after the first task, reunites with Harry, which is huge achievement to him. Second task goes, and Harry's guessed it. To go to the Black Lake. Harry tries to find a book so that he can breathe under water. He couldn't find such book. Dobby the house elf, who is free and is being paid by Dumbledore at Hogwarts for work, gives Harry a substance called Gillyweed. Harry finds he's got to rescue Ron, who is guarded by merpeople . While crossing dangers, Harry recieves 2 nd position. Third task is to cross a maze, full of dangerous creatures. Meanwhile Daily Prophet news reporter, Rita Skeeter is making rumours about Harry, Harry and Cedric reach the Triwizard cup, in the maze. Cedric asks Harry to take it, and Harry asks Cedric to take it. Finally, both of them touch it together, but they get transported to a Graveyard, which Harry suspects is the one he saw in his dream. And then, Pettigrew says, Avada Kedavra(killing curse), on Cedric. He dies. Harry sees Pettigrew put his blood, a bone and Harry's blood in a cauldron. Voldemort arises. He duels with Voldemort and escapes somehow. Fudge, Minister of Magic does not believe That Voldemort has returned. Hermione finds out that Rita Skeeter was and non registered, basically illegal animagus, and that's how she's been overhearing things. Harry's typical 4 year finishes, but how long he's got to go?My reviews for story- Joanne has nailed it. I love it. I don't like the movie for this one, however. I prefer book than movies, as it provides more details. I am a true Potterhead. I have read 5th book, but now I am reviewing this book. Harry is truly brave, and this book is for all ages and gender.""]";The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out.

There are plenty of good quality pictures and plenty of text explaining not only the discovery itself but also the civilisation and culture of the people who lived in Ur.

What struck me was the beauty of the items, the golden bull, the ram in the thickets and the exquisite jewellry.  Despite being millenium old they are of the very highests craftsmanship something one could not buy today for all the tea in china and are proof that man despite all his flaws has always been capable of producing works of real beauty. The visit also created the desire to find out more about Ur and its culture.

It is an easy read but not as easy to fully grasp the intensity.The protagonist - Billy Pilgrim, is seen to possess an involuntary time travelling malady, and hence the novel is written in a hopping timeline.Billy is not stable in any form after the war; he loses sense of time and sense itself. He is a wealthy family man after the war, but it is no consolation. He suffers..From alien abduction to PTSD and the horrors of war, Kurt Vonnegut leaves no stone unturned to mimick and vilify war.From the first-hand experience of being a POW, the writer justifies the childish sculpture of war, and the silliness of slaughter.

Alice fällt durch einen Kaninchenbau mitten ins verrückte Wunderland. Auf ihrer Reise trifft sie auf den Hutmacher, die Grinsekatze und den Schnapshasen. Spielkarten werden zum Leben erweckt und dann muss sie mit der roten Königin ein Duell austragen. Doch diese liebt es ihren Gästen den Kopf abzuschlagen… In diesem Buch befinden sich die Geschichten von „Alice im Wunderland“ und „Alice hinter den Spiegeln“ Ich wollte sie schon immer lesen und da kam mir diese Schmuckausgabe gerade recht. Die Illustrationen sind wirklich wunderschön. Der Zeichenstil ist einzigartig und definitiv etwas für wahre Buchliebhaber. Da geht einem das Herz auf! Das Buch ist in Kapitel eingeteilt, zwischen denen sich immer Zeichnungen befinden. Lewis Correll hat definitiv auch eine Vorliebe für Gedichte, welche er immer wieder zwischen die Seiten streut. Bevor ich das Buch gelesen habe, wusste ich bereits, dass diese Geschichte von Lewis Carroll etwas verrückt sein würde und das hat sich letztendlich auch bewahrheitet. Der Schreibstil ist außergewöhnlich. Er schweift manchmal ab, sodass manche Szenen etwas länger werden, was durch Wiederholungen noch untermauert wurde. Dennoch kann man das Buch einfach verstehen und der Schreibstil wirkt nicht ganz so veraltet wie bei manch anderen Klassikern. Wortspiele wurden zwischen den Sätzen verwendet und mir haben besonders die lebhaften und doch sehr lebhaften Beschreibungen gefallen. Mit Alice als Hauptcharakter hatte ich manchmal meine Probleme. In den Filmen habe ich sie total ins Herz geschlossen, jedoch hat man bei dieser 7-jährigen Alice ihre Kindlichkeit angemerkt. Sie wirkte etwas willkürlich und oberflächlich, da sie ständig ihre Meinung geändert hat. Ich konnte mir kein richtiges Bild von ihr machen. Teilweise erschien sie altklug und hochnäsig, sodass sie keine wirkliche Sympathieträgerin war. Es tauchen neben Alice auch Fantasiefiguren auf, so, wie die Grinsekatze, welche ich wirklich unglaublich gerne mochte. Die rote Königin konnte ich durch ihren durchgängigen Satz „Kopf ab mit ihr / ihm“ oftmals nicht ernst nehmen. Sie gehörte hier jedoch auch zu meinen liebsten Charakteren. Sie haben alle etwas Einzigartiges an sich – äußerlich und innerlich. Das hat die Geschichte unglaublich unterhaltsam gemacht. Spannung hat mir während des ganzen Buches gefehlt. Es gab immer wieder Treffen mit neuen Wesen, jedoch keinen roten Faden. Jedoch sollte man dabei nicht vergessen, dass es sich hierbei immer noch um ein Kinderbuch handelt. Der erste Band hat mir definitiv besser gefallen, als „Alice hinter den Spiegeln“. Durch den Film hatte ich ein total anderes Bild von der Geschichte und mich hat das Schachspiel eher verwirrt als begeistert. „Alice im Wunderland“ ist jedoch eine tolle, fantasiereiche Geschichte, welche auch alleine stehen kann. Fazit: Das Buch hat mir durch die fantasiereichen Beschreibungen und den übernatürlichen Wesen gut gefallen. Alice als Protagonistin mochte ich hingegen nicht so gerne und mir fehlte der rote Faden. Der Schreibstil hingegen ist außergewöhnlich, aber keinesfalls altertümlich. Für eine Schmuckausgabe ist es wirklich wunderschön illustriert worden, sodass man sich die Bilder gerne länger anschaut. Ich gebe dem Buch 4 bis 4,5 Sterne.', 'Wher khan so etwass lessen? Rechtschreibfehler für meinen Geschmack zu viel, habe aufgehört damit.

Im Traum folgt Alice einem weißen Kaninchen in dessen Bau und landet unvermittelt in einem Wunderland. Dort treiben allerlei wunderliche Gestalten ihren Spott und ihre Späße.

Moreover, he knows how to write and present that to others after his thinking gets over.  So, when God and Computers are to be brought together, he has left his mark through the six lectures he delivered at MIT by invitation.The lectures, however, draws a lot of examples from his project on Bible 3:16.  At times, it seemed to be better to read his book on Bible 3:16 first, and then read this lecture series.  He has been candid in stating his belonging to a specific branch of the Christianity (Lutheran), and at times the lectures gave a feeling that a thorough study of Bible (or history of Bible) would be helpful before reading this lecture series.Setting that apart, there is enough food for thought to a computer scientist.  The first lecture states when it comes to theology Mr. Knuth is a user, not a developer.  That instills a unique feeling to every programmer and computer scientist I am sure:  when it comes to programming this tribe sits in the developers seat and they can now imagine how they can be perceived by the users if the work is done right.My second takeaway was the statement that talked about the importance of rational expression of all emotional feelings, but how hard it is to do in reality.The third and final takeaway was his experience in writing ""Surreal Numbers"".

While no alien sighting has actually been verified yet, the idea of aliens visiting us regularly, or even living among us incognito, has become all too quotidian. Even kids are familiar with the concept, thanks to animated series like Men in Black and Ben 10. Today, this book will only please die-hard believers in aliens who are likely to discover many “proofs” in support of their belief. What I find more interesting is the way the discourse on aliens in this book is still tinged with Americentrism and Eurocentrism. Of course, the author could not understandably overcome the common prejudices of his times. Nor could he have foreseen Asian (India and China’s) progress in space science in 1968.

My intention was to learn more regarding how Bob Stewart developed his thinking on the Underworld.  I found this book packed with information not always clearly explained.  At times this is wordy and confusing. Mr. Stewart at this point in his career, reads like an academician.  This isn\'t always the best way to communicate. Not everyone envies one who talks over their heads.  I had to read paragraphs over more than one time to extract a meaning.  Even then, I was not always certain at what the author meant. As an author attempting to communicate his knowledge and  I would give Mr. Stewart a C- on his attempt.  There is clearly much information to learn from this book; on similarities between pagan and Christian mystery traditions; on East and Western traditions; on the Underworld Tradition;..  Essentially this is the foundation for his believe in the Underworld Tradition.  There is often a negative, condescending tone, especially towards the field of psychology.  I forgive him because here he is younger, passionate, idealistic and desperate to prove himself.  I assume at this point in Mr. Stewart\'s career his ideas were evolving; he wasn\'t as sure of himself; he didn\'t explain things  well. I suppose the other possibility is that I don;\'t have the cognitive ability to sort this all out.  His later books, to me, are works of art.  Nearly every word is important; he explains himself well; he doesn\'t meander around but gets to the point; he expresses himself in a clear manner that is understandable to most readers.  This is a glimpse of a younger Stewart trying to make sense out of esoteric Western Magical Tradition while also attempting to razzle dazzle his readers with his intelligence and learning.  Given the importance of the material presented in this book, I would  like to see Mr. Stewart rewrite this book as a mature author.  He could better clarify and explain these concepts.  I have the utmost of respect for this man and his contributions.  I just think this as one of his first works,  does not measure up to his present ability to clarify and teach.  Had I read this book first I probably would not have read his later works.  I would have been discouraged.  Glad I did.', 'This book blew me away in its scholarly approach to ancient folk songs and the bardic tradition and what these reveal about true magic and UnderWorld initiation. My brain kept going off like popcorn as RJ Stewart explained (in depth and through tradition) conclusions that I\'d drawn through personal experience. I love that he\'s not in any way, shape or form a New Age fluff bunny, and he shares my frustration with how watered down, black/white, and disempowering most versions of ""spirituality"" have become. I was pleasantly surprised to find his insights into Christian tradition both deep and engaging. I loved this book so much that after three chapters I went on his site and ordered another four books to go along with this one and the two others (as yet unread) that I ordered from Amazon. I can\'t recall any other author I\'ve ever done this with before or since.A note for readers who prefer ""Wicca Lite"" or who think faeries are all like Tinkerbell: you probably won\'t like this book. The paragraphs are dense. I\'ve studied folklore and the Faery Tradition for decades, and I have an academic background myself. Even given that, I often found myself rereading paragraphs three or more times in order to fully grasp their meaning. This is the kind of book that seeps into your heart before your left brain really comprehends what he says. It\'s powerful and potent, but slow reading and probably of minimal interest for the dabbler.']";

First, already understanding the basics from the CWG books, I don\'t feel this book covers some of the basics (or at least not early in the book) in a way that would overcome MY objections about the source of its inspiration like I had to overcome in the original books.Second, it seems as though the author has interjected too much of his own summaries and understandings into some of the answers.  For example, while ""God"" claims to have no vested interest in what the human race does or does not do, certain sections, especially the section on ""School"" seem to have very clear suggestions about changes that should be made and desirable outcomes.  Also, there is lingo in this book which is very recognizable in some of today\'s new age workshops.  This lingo wasn\'t used by ""God"" in the original books and it seems, (to use one of those words), ""inauthentic"" in this book.I intend to give this to my child with the same advice the author gives:  Believe all of it, believe none of it, or believe some of it, but think about it and what YOU feel is right and let\'s talk, if you want to.  I hope that she will not discount the best parts of this book because she senses, as I do, a little too much human involvement in some of the advice offered.

I would have really enjoyed to know more of his personal opinions and perspectives on the deeper meanings and origins of the runes - I'm sure he would have a lot of theoretical and philosophical insight on the subject, given his background, but it looks like you wont find any of that without paying for a membership on his Rune-Net website."", 'This excellent book, written by an author with long and extensive experience of esoteric runology, gives exactly what it promises: a sound, no-nonsense introduction to the Nordic runes. In the author\'s words: ""It is intended as a starting point. Not a complete volume of everything, but a basic foundation from which anyone can begin their studies from an informed perspective.""Unlike some other writers, Sweyn Plowright does not make any unsubstantiated claims or indulge in unwarranted speculation regarding the interpretation of the runes. Everything in the book is based on primary sources (e.g. the Eddas and the Rune Poems) only. After a brief introduction and a chapter devoted to putting the runes in their historical and modern context, Plowright discusses the genuine, old sources with particular attention to the Old English, Old Norse and Old Icelandic Rune Poems. The translations of the Rune Poems deviate a little from some others that I have read; unfortunately, I do not have enough knowledge of Old English or Old Norse to judge which translations are more valid (learning these is high on my agenda!) He then goes on to describe the modern runic revival, dominant concepts in runology (ørlög, wyrd and hamingja), esoteric interpretations of the runes, resources (including a discussion of popular authors, many of whom Plowright has met in person) and closes with a chapter on `myth busting\'.So thorough is the author in debunking modern myths or at least placing them in their proper context that the reader may come away feeling like he or she has been deluged with copious amounts of cold water. However, it is important then to read Plowright\'s closing words: ""It may be tempting to seek an escape from an imperfect World, but it is far more noble and rewarding to face the real World, appreciate what we have, and see the wonder that is right in front of us.""My favourite quotation from the book: ""His [List\'s] interpretations were largely based on the 18 riddles or spells mentioned in the Havamal.. [these] were unlikely to have referred to futhark runes. The word `rune\' can also refer to a spell or mystery"" - a point of view with which I completely agree.This is not a book that will tell the beginner how to get started with rune magic or divination, but it is indispensable as a foundation for putting further studies in their proper context. I can thoroughly recommend it not only to aspiring rune magicians but also to experienced ones who may need to re-examine much of the `received wisdom\'.', 'Having been interested in runes for some 30 years now, I was pleased to find that this little book is the most honest and factual book on the subject I have ever read outside of the sphere of academic publications.  It is not a long book, for the simple reason that the author has decided to stick to the verifiable facts, and there really isn\'t a great deal of historical material to go on.  If you\'re interested in the modern day ""spiritual"" applications of the runes, or in the speculative re-creation of what our ancestors might have done with them from the perspective of ""living history"", I don\'t think there\'s a better book on the market to give you a solid grasp of the essentials, and of what is factual and what is not (ie: 99% of what\'s been written about them).  Some reviewers have disliked the authors criticism of some of the popular New Age/Neopagan authors, but these criticisms are absolutely valid, and need to be said.  Although the book is short, there are plenty of links and references given which the reader can use for further investigation.  The author does have a few prejudices of his own (eg: he clearly likes the idea of ""rune magic"", despite the scarcity of historical evidence for it), but in such cases, he clearly tells the reader that the matter is controversial, and that he\'s made a personal decision to come down on a particular side of the fence).  Overall, if you\'re looking for the typical New Age/Neopagan fantasy type books on runes, you probably won\'t like this book much, but if you care about real history, I doubt you\'ll find a better introduction to the subject.']";Sorting fact from fiction about runes has become increasingly difficult in recent years. The number of rune books has multiplied, but the majority of them are based on speculation, or even complete fantasy, and are often contradictory and confusing. Some readers may be content to settle for these, but a growing number of rune students have been asking for a basic factual foundation so that they can judge for themselves the reliablility of the information in the esoteric rune books. The Rune Primer at last bridges the gap between the dry, complex, and expensive academic works, and the less reliable

It’s difficult to be reminded of that… but it’s harder to forget.""</i>It’s a slow-moving book with a lot of elaborate details, and the mysteries are unraveled through these details. I, generally, prefer fast-paced ones with lesser details, but this book just pulled me into its gravitational field. Slowly and gradually, it made me feel one with the characters.The story is sketched around a post-apocalyptic earth, but does not dwell on the apocalypse or its aftermath. It focusses on two people and their journeys during & after the apocalypse. Two people, one on earth and one in space, connected in an uncanny way through their attachment to their mothers, feelings of abandonment in childhood, loneliness, intelligence, and detachment, and a deeper mystery that’s unraveled only in the final chapters. Both their journeys are similar. Both Augustine and Sullivan want detachment and aloneness. One chooses the Arctic zone and the other chooses the space to live their loneliness.<i>""What it was about the loneliness of space that had made her leave everything behind.""</i>But when reality of a post-apocalyptic earth and the end of humankind stare them at the face, both regret their choices and crave for what they had left behind.<i>""Since the evacuation, since Iris, he had felt more earthbound than he had in years. There was a time when the changes in the sky meant more to him than the ground beneath his feet, but not right then.""</i>This book reflects the reality of human life. We choose our paths only to wish differently when reality stares us in the face. The silence of reality and nothingness brings us face-to-face with the thoughts hidden in the deep, remote corners of our brains, and that’s when we know what we really wanted from life, but sometimes it’s too late.<i>""Here, at the very end of his life, he had so much to say and yet so little strength to say it.""</i>', ""Not worth the money. It's 8 hours I will never get back. Don't bother with this book. Much better Sci-fi out there."", 'Minor spoilers below.This is one of those books about the characters, rather than the action. Nevertheless I was gripped by it. I found myself thinking about it even after I\'d finished it, wondering about what might have been... So many unanswered questions, not least of which is WHAT HAPPENED? And DID THEY MAKE IT? We aren\'t told. Quite clever of the author to leave certain things to our imagination. I reckon any attempt to explain within the book would fall far short of what we\'re all imagining. The ending leaves us hanging, and for me, wanting more. Can hardly believe this is the author\'s debut book. Bravo. Definitely enjoyed it, was reluctant to put it down. Daughter read it too and enjoyed it thoroughly.One question for the publisher - is it supposed to be read back to front? Don\'t laugh at me for rationalising that the pages being arranged in reverse order somehow goes with the symbolism of the plot. Was it just a publishing error? I kid you not, in my copy, page 1 was at the back, then page 2 etc as you read, each page bringing you closer to the front, instead of the back. Every page was in the right place, just in reverse order. I feel foolish for admitting that I even searched on Google to look for the answer, but there was no mention of it. Surely if it was a publishing ""gimmick"" someone would have mentioned it? I feel genuinely confused. Doubtless thousands of people are shaking their heads that I\'m too thick to realise that the reverse order was all tied in with the plot. Oh well. Another mystery.

Forget the narrative subtleties, forget the mammoth-whale chase and forget all the cetological whalelore, if not the geo-aesthetics, and we are left with the sea – the omnipotent, omnipresent and the omnicidal. But between the potency and the presence lies the chasm upon which the phantom feeds. The phantom is but a whale, haunting and haunted; and Moby-Dick is neither about a whale nor about the chase. It is about the monstrosity of the sea that undulates within the interstices of the hull – the tremor of which is never seen but only felt in the prosthesis of the spine. It is about the intensities and the multi-variegated interface of the oblique waves that refracts too less of geometry then rejects all that we managed to grasp. Too much of spermaceti but too little is the light to illumine the abyss of the thalassic mind.O Reader, do you think it’s about a monomaniac vengeance? Well then, offend I must the humanists, for the topological multiplicity of the oceanic offers a yawning analysis of that grinning jawbone chased by a prosthetic-legged man, for when they meet each other, a shudder of the flukes sends splinters into the heart that holds the harpoon – a paroxysm of grief and all that we have lost in the singular spasm of the sea. It is not about vengeance but about the viperous obliquity of the splash that carries enough venom to deafen the mad. The splash is present in the arcs of the spine and the phantom-whale is but a figment of the splash upon that ancient spine and to hunt it is the inception of Vikriti upon the Virat and all the grandeur in catastrophic harmony gathers into a vortex upon which hovers a single “black bubble”, where the disreality of non-utterance concentrates and atomizes perpetually. We are but forced to lunge into it only to emerge out again into an event of disbelief where our hammers freeze and all tongues collapse but the red flag that was yet to be nailed into the mainmast-head ripples quite gently upon the haphazard shivers of the ocean – an ocean become all froth and foam from the tear-stricken eyes of sailors exiled within the wrecks under the eddies.We, the Shakespearean Protozoa, drunk with a literary overdose of lysergic acid, turn to face the jaw of the whale within which our Monadic ancestors lie. But even before we are lowered into our boats, we but see fractals folding and frowning at us from the forehead of the whale beyond which our visions collapse. The spout sprays butane and all we see is vapour. Moby-Dick is gas and in search of Thalassa, all of us are Ahabs behind slouched hats, foolishly branded with the stigma of monomania, when we are trying to discover Marina, like lost-Ulysseses become hollow-Prufrocks, exhausted in our drifting-oceanic voyage, all of us seeking a way to evaporate before the spermaceti lanterns extinguish.Surreal.P.S: Apologies, I do not know how to write, for when an Ahab is dragged into the depths and a Pip lost forever and with neither any Starbucks who cherish nor any Stubbs who cheer, all a stupid reader like me can do is float under the black bubble of constant sorrow where I see myself burst.I apologise to the world for the foolishness I am.', ""Got the book for ₹350. It was supposed to take six days, but arrived in two. The packaging was in a hard cardboard box, so the binding and pages were safe in transit. Kudos to Amazon/Seller for choosing to do this rather than the poly bag packaging they sent last time (which sadly ruined the spine of my Wuthering Heights book).As for the book itself, the Oxford World's Classics edition includes a descriptive introduction, a well researched etymology, very helpful explanatory notes with words marked with asterisks in the work itself for references, and most helpfully Melville's personal letters to Hawthorne regarding this book. It makes for a very comprehensive book to own, and I would recommend it to anyone for this price (the MSRP sticker quotes ₹399, so do not pay any more than that for the sellers that have upmarked it for no reason at all, and look at another publishing in this price range!).The cover of it was a bit dirty, but it was most probably due to the age it sat on the shelf than anything else, and there were still no visible signs of any damage on the cover or the pages themselves. As for the seller, I got it from Manav Books and would personally recommend them to another buyer, though your own experience may vary. All in all, I was worried when I ordered due to it being the last one in stock and with it being marked at a third of the price of the next lowest seller, but I got a perfectly good copy of it that lives up to my satisfaction.As for Melville himself, well, the praise you've heard for him is probably less than what he deserves. The prose is utterly brilliant in execution, and the destructive narrative approach with a non-linear approach is somehow made to work really well. I won't comment much on the metaphysical or the alussions or the metaphors or the references (of which have already been made many in my short time reading it!), but trust me the level of care and devotion put into writing it is second to none. I'd suggest this for someone who already has experienced reading Shakespeare's works (especially Macbeth and King Lear, at the minimum), Paradise Lost by John Milton, and old verses of significant literary importance if it be possible.The author expects you to be well-read and highly intellectual. There's a bar of entry into getting into the book and enjoying it to its fullest potential, but for an experienced reader this is a mesmerising experience.Hemingway was wrong: American Literature does not start with Huckleberry Finn; it starts with Moby Dick.PS: The font size is bigger than the font in Penguin's edition of Paradise lost, and the print and paper quality are far better so don't worry on that front."", 'Nothing substantial can be added to glory of the book so I will focus on this particular edition which has original illustrations by Rockwell Kent.

It is not about Cassie's last words, but about her life and how she came out of the darkness using her faith.It was certainly not a smooth road for Cassie to change her ways but that is exactly the reason why I thought this book was inspiring. The struggles in this story were very real, but Cassie and her family came out of it triumphant. It also goes to show that in order to be spiritual you don't even have to be into one particular religion, and you certainly don't have to appear perfect. Even after Cassie gave her life to God, she still was the Cassie who wore punk/alternative clothing with the same struggles she had before, but her faith was what motivated her to always strive for better. It wasn't about changing who she was, but about changing her ways and her attitudes towards things. I found this book very inspiring because it was very easy to relate to the story on so many different levels. Teens and adults/parents alike will be able to relate to it!This book also isn't preachy, it's not about religion but about an amazing young woman who turned her life around. I admire Misty's sympathetic attitude towards the killers and their families along with her views on the kind of bitterness and hostility that eventually resulted in the massacre.

In fact, I have only read J. Taraborrelli's 'Madonna: An Intiminate Biography. Also, the many articles in pop magazines, Newspapers and  the very few biography films on Madonna out there.Rarely do these points of references on Madonna delve into her musicality. They generally (if ALL) seem to be about her iconic status as an influential woman of the 20th and 21st centuries, a feminist and as a women who pushes the buttons of controversy. Her music generally is usually hinted at, NOT generally delved deep into; that is until NOW, in Lucy O' Brian's new biography on Madonna: ' Madonna: Like an Icon'.One of the most incredible revelations in this new biography is how Lucy O Brian gives the reader perspectives on Madonna that we don't usually hear or read enough about.Perspectives like: Her musicality, how her music is actually created, how Madonna works in the recording studio and how she is with her dancers. These are all revelations that make this particular biography ultimately unique from all the other biographies on Madonna out there, including the very few music film biographies on her.I never brought Madonna's Greatest Hits 'The Immaculate Collection' on CD, but I did get the vhs cassette. There are two parts to Madonna's music career; the beginning of her career where the world got to hear Madonna in 1983. Songs like ' Lucky Star, Get Into the Grove, Material Girl,etc...etc...When she reaches to the single ' Express Yourself' this is a period in her career, where that classic sound of her music expression changes into new recording dimensions. She ventured into more ambient electronic dance music.The immaculate Collection album ends with the song 'Vogue'.This part of Madonna's discography is the 'classic' Madonna sound. Everything released after the single 'Vogue' went into new musical expressions.What is incredible is that the two people who were mainly responsible for this classic sound have hardly 'EVER' truly been given the recognition they truly deserve in the success of Madonna's career until NOW in Lucy O'Brians book.The names of Shepp Pettibone and Jellybean Benitz are two names that ( I believe) should really be shouted from the rooftops, and I am truly happy that these two men have been given the recognition they truly deserve in Lucy O Brian's biography.I could write how truly incredible this biography is, but If I did, you would be reading this for a very long time.I will just naturally say that because of who Madonna is in popular music culture and because Lucy O Brian is naturally one of the finest music biographers that the United Kingdom has EVER produced, what you have Here in this new biography about Madonna's life and music career, is a biographer who has written a book about Madonna that truly needed to be written, and (I Believe) there is nobody better in the world like Lucy O Brian ,who could have written a biography like this, on one of the most iconic EVER of female music artists.I truly believe in a few years time-like Hunter Davis book on the Beatles; this book by Lucy O' Brian, will be regarded as the one and ONLY truly definitive book to have been written about Madonna.An incredible read and (in my opinion), one of the GREATEST music biography books EVER written."", ""These days Madonna is more popular outside Anglosphere and in this context the new (cheaper) edition of the book serves more than one purpose:1.

This story hugely focuses on the concept of death and life, of redemption and resurrection. Taking place in two cites; Paris and London at a time when the people were living under the kings like petty insects with a thirst for revenge rising in their midst. Dark secrets brewing behind the rising blood of the French Revolution, we get an in depth view of the state of the common innocent people who got stuck in between this bloodbath.The story opens by describing the situations in France and England as Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a respectable banker of the Tellson\'s Bank, a businessman through and through is on his way from London to Dover where nobody trusts anybody. They are stopped by a messenger looking for Mr. Lorry, who returns the message he received by sending his own, ""Recalled to Life"" And thus, the idea of resurrection began.This tale doesn\'t just draws us in the lives of these characters which have been woven and knitted so delicately it also gives us an understanding on the human nature. It shows us how the thirst for revenge can turn into the reason why the revenge was seeked. Madame Defarge, a very important character in this book is shown to be silently knitting all the time, but keenly hears and sees everything happening around her. The knitting she does is a very important aspect of the story. Dickens tries to throw this back to the Fates in the Greek Mythology, where the three fates knit the fates of people and when a person is to die they cut off a string. The same way Madame Defarge keeps knitting with all of her sisterhood the fates of the people she believes has done wrong to her and her beloved. She wants to damn a whole family and see them dead even if not all of the are guilty. Her thirst for revenge grows so much that she wants to vanquish the line altogether.""The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.""The wine here represents the blood of all those innocents upon whose back the French aristocrats built their lives. It foreshadows to when the people of France would rise up as one and turn the tables against said aristocrats.The three main characters in this story that draw all the strings of the tapestry together are; Lucie Manette, daughter of a doctor who was unfairly put into the Bastille for 18 years to be forgotten is seventeen when introduced in the year 1775. She has always thought herself an orphan until Mr. Lorry, an old friend of Dr. Manette tells her that her father is alive and is at the residence of the Defarges who had been in service to the doctor a long time ago. Hearing this Lucie and Mr. Lorry go and find Dr. Manette in a state where he doesn\'t even remember his name. All he knows now is the name of his cell and to make shoes. They find him bent over his work with barely any light coming through. He is not in a fit state of mind and neither Mr. Lorry nor Defarge, the wine seller and husband to Mrs. Defarge can get anything out of him. But when he sees Lucie he stops working and actually looks at her. Her presence calms him and recalls him to life. They go back to England with Mr. Lorry as their escort where they live in a small house in Soho.The story reopens five years hence with the love interest, Charles Darney who is being wrongly accused of treason in England. Charles Darney\'s biggest secret plays a huge part in the story as he is part of a family of French aristocrats, the same family that had been responsible for Dr. Manette\'s long imprisonment. Sydney Carton, the brilliant yer dissolute alcoholic English lawyer gets Charles aquitted.Onto, the third character who plays a highly important role we are introduced to a young Englishman; Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton\'s character is one of the most complex one. He is in love with Lucie Manette who he knows he can\'t have so he makes a pact to keep her and all those she loves safe. All through the book Sydney thinks of himself as a damned soul and looks for redemption.""To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.""This pretty much summaries the condition of both the cities during the time of when the book takes place. Everything looks good when you see it from afar but when you look closely you just realise how wrong the world truly is.""I tell thee,"" said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, ""that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing.""This has been said by Mrs. Defarge and shows the readers how muchthe thirst for revenge can destroy a person from within. That once this fire starts it is next to impossible to ever stop it. It just wants more and more. It always keeps advancing, always keeps growing. This is a way for the author to warn us against going down this road.""It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued""This represents how the seeked peace but could never could quit grab onto it because it always seemed just out of reach. Mankind has always been prone to destruction and this is no different. To achieve absolute peace is just an idealist though and not a realistic one.""For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.""This quote describes how Lucie Manette, was feeling the brewing of a storm that was to strike soon on her happy life with her family. The echoing footsteps she heard, of the danger to come would disturb her greatly even though her life was well and good until then.""Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning""The answer for violence is never violence and the answer for death isn\'t death because the French Revolution had taken a turn and a sharp female, newly-born called La Guillotine had arrived and a new kind of bloodshed had started in which Lucie and her dear family got stuck without having done any wrong.""For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.""The story is so incredibly woven together that you won\'t understand everything until the very end when it will all come to sense. Charles Dickens has a fascinating wat of story telling that it puts you in the same place as the characters and makes you live the story. You can feel the grief and the pain of what the characters are going through and the poetic writing style wants you to never leave the book alone. And nothing but a quote from this book itself can represent how I felt reading it:""No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all.""', ""The book is a treasure for readers.

And even more crucially, one that you should have read by now. However, as one of its most distinguishing features is its staggering length, many of us feel intimidated and perhaps, even, fatigued at the thought of diving in. Alain de Botton’s hilarious and unexpected Proustian manual, is then, the perfect antidote to this problem.In How Proust Can Change Your Life, de Botton masterfully distils what Proust says about friendship,

Challenging the notion that Canadians are &#147;nice,&; the book asks, &#147;Do we as Canadians deserve a country so great?&; Tackling subjects from Canada's favorite inbred royals to the mighty beaver as national icon, from sex in a canoe to all-Canadian ""superhero"" Captain Canuck, Ferguson rampages across the cultural landscape.

It would be easy to write the same tale over and over again with a few name changes but this author is a master story teller and each one mines another aspect of a 1960s primitive society. This book is no exception and it is written with her usual flair and logic. This time she has a civilized Irish family resident on the banks of a river in the Irish midlands. When an American widower with his son and daughter moves from America to find his roots, and already very rich, he buys up an old ruined building to restore it to working order. Immediately the village is divided into factions,- those in favour on the pretext of growth and wealth and those against. Complications arise throughout the saga as American daughter is attracted to Irish son and Irish daughter to American son. The building and various incidents keep the pages turning until a climax is reached as the building, now an up market hotel, is officially opened. What happens next is unexpected and final. All this time the Irish mother, wise and attractive, has an accident on the building site and is crippled and confined to a wheel chair. The ensuing compensation claim against the American widower is full of bitter fury but also of compassion and under standing. One is left enthralled but saddened at the behaviour of certain characters but good prevails in the end and another Binchy masterwork hits the print presses.', ""I have been meaning for ages to read something by this very popular well-loved writer.  Maybe I picked the wrong one to start with.

A rich American comes to Ireland to rebuild an ancestral home as a hotel.  A lady who has welcomed the American and become friendly with him, wanders onto the building site to look around, for reasons which escape me.  This seems incredible now but I suppose it is set in the sixties when health and safety hadn't been invented. The lady ends up in a wheelchair, the hotel burns down and the American decides America is his home not Ireland.

With this book I saw the dementia from Iris's husband's view too."", ""Iris Murdoch is someone I've only recently discovered as a writer, a great writer and her portrait, as she is seen and remembered by her hubbie, tells us as much about him as about her, and much about their marriage.Memoir is as much about the writer as about the person being remembered...I wonder what he left out."", 'In 1996, one year after novelist Iris Murdoch told an interviewer that she was struggling with severe writer’s block, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, a neurodegenerative disorder that destroys memory and other mental functions. Her husband, writer John Bayley, becomes her primary caretaker. He also becomes her chronicler, keeping detailed notes about her stunning and precipitous decline before she dies of the disease in 1999.“Elegy for Iris,” is released almost a year before her death, when her body is going through the motions of living that her mind has long since abandoned. Murdoch’s fall is even more horrifying given her stature and accomplishments at the height of her literary powers. The disease transforms an erudite and vibrant woman into a murmuring simpleton who delights in watching “Teletubbies,” a children’s show, on the television.In contrast to many other memoirs about disease, “Elegy” mentions doctors only one time, and it is in the context of her brain scans reminding Bayley of a map of the Amazon – vast, dark and unknown. That kind of poetic interpretation infuses this entire work. The disease is what she now isn’t, and her absence is heartbreaking. The loss feels palatable even if you don’t know her work. “Elegy” is a sad but lyrical tribute to an amazing woman by the deft writing of a devoted and literate husband.']";With remarkable tenderness, John Bayley recreates his passionate love affair with Iris Murdoch--world-renowned writer and philosopher, and his wife of forty-two years--and poignantly describes the dimming of her brilliance due to Alzheimer's disease. Elegy for Iris is a story about the ephemeral beauty of youth and the sobering reality of what it means to grow old, but its ultimate power is that Bayley discovers great hope and joy in his celebration of Iris's life and their love. In its grasp of life's frailty and its portrayal of one of the great literary romances of this century, Elegy for Iris is

It does not promise to be a complete reference, nor does it purport to be a literature course of any kind. It offers to be a friendly and casual guide, and that is exactly what it is. There are 13 chapters, distinguished by topic: bad girl books, exploring our sexuality, hearing your inner voice, coming of age, mother issues, existential crises, taking care of business, midlife crisis, political, bad hair babe, martyr queen and embracing your inner light books. The approach is breezy and mildly informative, though one does wonder why it is ""our"" sexuality but ""your"" inner voice.Each chapter begins with a one or two page humorous essay followed by reading suggestions, each with a paragraph or two of description and comments, a couple of humorous discussion questions, and a miscellany of quotes, facts and reminiscences. The first chapter, for example, ""When You\'re Ready to Embrace Your Inner B!tch: Bad Girl Books"" features Moll Flanders (1722), The Scarlet Letter (1850), Gone With the Wind (1936), The Portable Dorothy Parker (1944), Auntie Mame (1955), Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962) and Too Good for Her Own Good: Searching for Self and Intimacy in Important Relationships (1990). Also included are a list of bad girls to invite to a girls\' night, Notes from Nancy\'s and Bev\'s Reading Journals, and quotes from a number of bad girls, including Cher and Carrie Nation.One\'s unsurprising complaint with a book like this: I want more. There are only 6 or 7 recommendations in each chapter. It\'s clear these authors are well read, so I would have liked more actual book and author recommendations, particularly ones I\'d never heard of. The books that were recommended were interesting and appropriate choices I thought -- there was one I\'d never heard of, a couple I\'d never got round to reading, a couple I\'d read many years ago, and a couple where I thought \'Oh yeah, I should read that\'. I enjoyed reading about books I\'d already read and appreciated being reminded of the ones where I\'d let myself be satisfied with the film, but would have liked at least another five I\'d never heard of. There is a lot of humorous filler, which works because the authors are good writers and funny, but the next edition needs more reviews. Also, putting the selections in chronological order would lend some historical context.Complemented by a good index, this is not a book to read straight through, but rather to be perused as the mood hits.As for previous critics\' claim that the book falsely purports to be for young women -- that would have been ""Grrrl\'s Guide to Books"", wouldn\'t it? The unnecessary meanness suggests some unresolved issues with mom. You know what? You\'ll like her again some day. Reread Chapter 5 and give her a call.', 'This is a great book to have around. It has some interesting selections. There are a few things in the book that are factually incorrect.

And I wont be able to maintain the book in my collection. The book can fall apart anytime .', 'Often when you see a book title and cover, you think you know the direction the story will take. It will be predictable, and within that formulaic storyline, you will find entertainment and relaxation. And then comes a book like this where your assumptions fall flat after a few plot twists and you are left satisfied at having being proven wrong.Grace Bernard has been in prison since 14 months. And she’s quite irritated about it. Why, you ask? Is she innocent? Au contraire! She has killed six people. The problem is that she got away with all those murders, and is in prison for a crime she didn’t commit. The irony! What follows is a heartfelt and humorous confession of sorts with Grace revealing what made her kill her family members and how she “executed” her plans.A major chunk of the story comes to us via a journal that Grace is writing in prison to divulge her outrage at having being unfairly imprisoned. This journal broadly contains three elements: Grace’s background about why her family became her target, her modus operandi behind the crimes, and her life in prison. Each of these is interestingly written with a great deal of sarcasm and practicality. The book goes by very fast because of her candid approach about her offences.Grace is such an interesting character. As most of the book is in the first person perspective of Grace, you will enjoy being in her mind as she unveils her life story. For one, it was refreshing to see a lead character acknowledge that she was attractive, such a refreshing change from all those beauties who seem unaware of their appeal until a man convinces them otherwise. Grace is also meticulous in planning out her tasks. The sincerity with which she plans out her targeted murders is simultaneously admirable and scary. She actually delights in her crimes, but she isn’t a psychopath. She is judgemental but justifies her critiques with a solid reasoning. This is one confusing character who will still make a mark on your heart.The story is dark and gruesome but Grace’s macabre deeds are overshadowed by her wittiness. The humour in the book is quite acerbic and tongue-in-cheek. I especially enjoyed those barbs at SM influencers in the Briony section. Couldn’t stop myself laughing at Grace’s hashtags!Overall, this is an easy-going book that seems predictable until you see that it is not quite as you thought. Pick it up when you want some light-hearted humour with dark twists.Trigger Alert: Spoiler Ahead: (Some of the content contains details of BDSM, so if that gets your goat, consider yourself warned.)The one thing I wish I could change about the book: its cover. That bland salmon pink cover just doesn’t do justice to this story.

No the final five or six percent of this book is the first chapter of the next book; so in reality I only had a few pages left and by any measure insufficient to justify the early night.

So anticipating a trap to catch the killer in that final chapter, I was really disappointed to learn that after the snowy confrontation with Cardinal [how does Cardinal get down the mountain when he\'s not dressed for the weather?] the killer does a runner and avoids the short arm of the Algonquin Bay Police Department and that\'s it, end of story.  Now I suppose that probably happens a lot in real life, but this is fiction and if the baddie gets away that\'s not really very satisfactory, I don\'t want reality I want retribution.[Spoiler alert over]So in summary a good story that builds on the first book, but disappointingly one with some loose ends, all a bit too contrived and convenient, and on the whole not as good as ""Forty Words For Sorrow"", although learning what to do when a power cable comes down near me may prove useful one day.However, although ""The Delicate Storm"" was disappointing, and while Blunt\'s descriptions of the weather in northern Ontario in winter is enough to put me off going there [I can\'t understand why any one would] unlike some of the other reviewers neither the disappointment or the descriptions of the weather are going to put me off the series.And that third whammy, I should have stayed up to watched Match of Day 2 to see Spurs beat Southampton with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min shredding the Southampton defence, oh well there\'s always the iPlayer.Recommended, but if you\'re new to Cardinal start at the beginning and not here.', 'Having seen ""Cardinal"" on BBC4..I read this and thought it was superior to the adaption of book 1(40 words for sorrow) and  moreover the characterisation ,plot and writing was more subtle and engaging than how it was portrayed  on TV...and have purchased and am reading with enjoyment ""Black Fly season""(Book 3).

But it has been enjoiable enough. I have read other books of Anne Stuart that i liked better.', '(3.5 stars) This book was originally published in 1993 and it does show its age a bit in certain aspects of the lives of the characters, but it\'s really a timeless tale of redemption and forgiveness.  And, in spite of its not very unique plot, that of a hardhearted, well-off, ruthless businessman who dies of a heart attack in his thirties and is forced back to earth to make amends to those he has wronged in order to deserve a place in heaven, the writing by Stuart makes it very readable and enjoyable.Stuart is known for her romances with bad boys as the heroes.  Many of them are almost anti-heroes. So she knows how to get us convinced of the almost irredeemable qualities of a guy.  But we meet this one when he is back on earth in a different body, with a different name, somewhat disoriented, and traveling along in an unfamiliar place in an unfamiliar truck.  He knows who he was, but this new body he inhabits is a bit of a mystery and why he is where he is another one.Well, all will be revealed as the story moves along.  And it moves along nicely. Well paced, well written, with interesting, well-developed characters, this tale will have you cheering on this ""angel"", wanting him to be able to perform his Christmas miracles and make amends for his former life.There\'s a romance here too, of course.  After all, this is Anne Stuart.  There\'s a woman he had wronged in his past life he must now make amends to, along with two more people, according to the dictates of the angel who had sent him back to earth.  There\'s actually a whole town he needs to make amends to, as you will find out as the story progresses.This was a lovely, heartwarming tale.

He gets a second chance to experience what is important in life and to make changes accordingly.Falling Angel by Anne Stuart looks into this same scenario.

Stuart sets you, the reader, right smack dab in the middle of a quaint Minnesota town, introduces you to it\'s citizens, and makes you fall in love with all of them.  Carrie, of course, is the focal point.  She is so GOOD, yet also carries such burdens with her.  The romance between her and Gabriel is really just ""destined"".

They knew an attack had begun but that many more could soon follow, a list of key targets was quickly put together and buildings evacuated. The White House was emptied, the president rushed onto a plane and towards a safe location. As passenger information began to filter through it was quickly established who was responsible. The book captures the scramble to ground all planes, to find out how many may be hijacked, 100 was the number feared at one stage, video conferences were hastily arranged to try and put together as much information as possible and to take quick decisions. Inside bunkers the US leaders tried to coordinate the responsible, a death toll of between 10,000-50,000 was feared in New York at tone point. It seems early on obvious it was a huge failure on the part of the FBI and the CIA to find and arrest the hijackers. President Bush was described as privately furious and demanding retribution. The writer also records his shock when after an exhausting long day he returned back to the office only to be told he must discover evidence to prove Iraq was behind the attack.The next few chapters are devoted to a how we got here case.Chapter 2 begins by explaining how 1979 was a pivotal year for the US in the cold war. The middle east suddenly became increasingly vital, the US lost one of it’s few allies during the 1979 revolution in Iran, a new hard-line islamist movement took power, meanwhile the Soviets entered Afghanistan in large numbers, not pausing just around Kabul but moving into every area of the country, taking the US and Carter totally off guard. Under Ronald Reagan the policy was to expand US influence and weaken the USSR. There was genuine concern that the Soviets could keep driving down into the middle east and take control of the world’s oil supplies. This fear though was probably based on faulty intelligence it’s admitted. The main charge laid at the door of the US government during the 1980s according to the writer is that it allowed Iranian and Syrian backed terrorists to drive them out of Lebanon, demonstrating that terrorism could defeat US willpower it seemed. The author though does believe it was right to support Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, given the hostility now in Iran to the US and it’s interest. The main plan though was to use Afghanistan as a base to draw the soviets into a conflict, forcing them to massively overspend and damaging their economy. The Afghan rebels scored some early victories but by 1985/6 helicopter attacks were beginning to take their toll on the rebel forces. By supplying them with Stinger missiles this took away that air power advantage. The author believes this was a correct strategy, and that no stringers were later used against American forces, given that they had limited battery life, many were returned and the funding ended once the soviets left. Had the soviets not made the mistake of trying to conquer the rural mountain regions they may have had greater success it’s argued. Clarke though believes the US made 3 mistakes, 1 being too reliant on Pakistan to channel arms, 2 little being known about the Arab volunteers entering the country, I’m not sure about this, wouldn’t it be just obvious they'd be hardcore jihadists? 3 the US lost interest in the country once the Soviets pulled out, the US had little influence now over events on the ground after. The US government did achieve it’s objective, winning the cold war did matter according to Clarke.Chapter 3 looks at the Bush years in the early 1990s.The Gulf war is quickly covered. There’s no embarrassing admission from Clarke that Saddam was a US ally during the 1980s. He seems to have skipped over this part. Some he argues were keen to avoid staying for years in Saudi Arabia to defend the country, therefore a quick victory, with a big broad collation was the correct approach. Clarke argues the US should not have entered Iraq afterwards, expect to protect forces encouraged to rise up against Saddam. The major US concern again during this time was oil, though the US government tried to argue otherwise. Saddam taking control of the worlds oil was not acceptable.The book also covers how close Iraq had come by 1991 to developing nuclear weapons, though ones it probably couldn’t yet deploy. By that period though the world was changing, the cold war was over, religion was becoming a more powerful political force in the middle east, new splinter groups, failed states, rogue nations were emerging. Little is said about Bush, the writer doesn’t seem to like giving him any credit compared to Clinton. The world trade centre bombing in 1993 is covered then, another security failure, attacks on US home soil were unexpected at the time it seemed. Terror networks were uncovered, Bin Laden’s name is mentioned though his role appears unclear at the time. Clinton at the same time had to deal with the fear of weapons of mass destruction across the world falling into the wrong hands, Saddam still a threat in the middle east, state sponsorship of terrorism, and new terror groups different from those in Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine. A plot is uncovered by Iraqi intelligence officers to try and assassinate former president Bush, this is foiled and Clinton allows a limited retaliatory strike. Clinton it feels can do little wrong in Clarke’s eyes.The book does suffer slightly from a “I was right all along” sense. How much of this was hindsight, how fair is it to look back to the 1990s and say we should have seen all this coming? For instance keeping US troops in Saudi Arabia seemed the right thing to do at the time, what was Richard Clarke’s view on that and how much did he see that as stoking anger against the US in the middle east? Clinton had 8 years in office, Bush had less than 1, yet he takes much of the blame in Clarke’s view for failing to take down Al-Qaeda.The rest of the book continues on through the 1990s. Bin Laden by this point with in the Sudan, exporting arms and financing terror in Egypt, the Philippines and Bosnia. Clarke oddly though claims Bosnia was a US success, though I’m not sure I agree with that. After much pressure Bin Laden switched location to Afghanistan. The military and the CIA under Clinton were reluctant to take action, seeing any mission to take him out as a risky anti terror opp on hostile foreign soil. There were even concerns it might be illegal too. Nor was there an appetite to invade and try to occupy Afghanistan. Russia had been there for over 10 years and taken heavy casualties, never fully controlling the country. By 1996/7 the CIA was looking into plans to snatch Bin Laden from Afghanistan, even drawing up plans to land on a small dirt airplane strip. It was decided thought the compounds he was staying in were too well guarded and casualties would be high.Meanwhile back on US homeland Clake had a great fear that there might be a bio weapon attack or a chemical attack. It was clear to him that many cities were unprepared, committees squabbled over funding and many mayors were not interested in the threat. The writer describes how he pushed hard for increased funding, rehearsals for attacks, a fire truck that could decontaminate an underground station and hundreds of people all at once. We then push forward to 1998 with US embassies bombed in Africa. Clarke pushed hard for a strong retaliation, cruise missiles strikes were launched by Clinton against terror camps in Afghanistan, though Clarke believes the build up of ships near Pakistan allowed Pakistan to tip off the Taliban that the strikes were being launched. Clarke even believed that Pakistan army intelligence officers may have been embedded in the Taliban at the time. Equally Pakistan would not have allowed US planes to fly over it’s airspace on the way to bomb targets in Afghanistan. Cruise missiles though take hours from being fired to hitting their targets, often the surprise is lost. Helicopter raids were also ruled out too. Instead Clarke then describes himself looking at how to cut off the finances of the terror group. This involved difficult conversations with the Saudis, Clarke describes the FBI as slow to respond, feeling themselves to be bound by the law, the CIA was also experiencing a culture of not getting to grips with the issue. Drones were launched over Afghanistan, but back in the late 90s they had no weaponry.Next came the bombing of a US ship in Yemen while in port, killing 17 US sailors. Security in Yemen was poor and Clarke was furious the ship had chosen to dock there. Terror camps in Afghanistan were not bombed though and Clarke saw this as a missed chance. The location of Bin Laden was also unknown. Intelligence was very poor, they often found out after where he had been staying, but never where he would be in say 3 days time. President Clinton was now out of time and election brought a new administration into power.Clarke seemed to find himself with reduced influence in the new administration, few people took his warnings seriously, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice all missed his warnings he claims. Meetings he asked for urgently were delayed. The new administration was more concerned about Iraq, not a terror organisation few people had ever heard of. A plan was suggested to put pressure on Pakistan and to finance the Northern Alliance. The director of the CIA though seemed to be on board with Clarke’s view. In the months leading up to 9-11 information wasn’t shared properly which should have prevented the attacks.Clarke then sets out what the US response should have been after the attacks. Bush should concentrated firstly on tightening up homeland vulnerabilities. Next Al-Qaeda should have been vigorously pursued and destroyed it’s funding cut off while Bush travelled the middle east, rallying support for the US and urging the Islamic world to unite against terror.What in fact followed was in invasion of Iraq which according to Clarke inflamed world opinion against America, the motives for war always shifting. Bush declared you were either with him or against him, meanwhile new departments were created, security became messy, departments began competing with no clear focus or overall leadership. Clarke makes it clear though he still believes in the civil rights and liberties of it’s citizens. He doesn’t want to see suspects arrested and held without trial or access to a lawyer. To his dismay the US government was also slashing funding by 2003 for police and fire departments, right at the wrong moment.Clarke views the war on terror as a battle of ideas, a new ideological mission is needed he writes to spread American ideas of plurality, democracy and capitalism. Clarke accepts that in the late 90s Clinton signed into law that regime change would become US policy. Still he feels this is not a justification for invasion. Efforts by the US government to link the war on terror and 9-11 with Iraq appalled Clarke, though Bush later did admit there was no evidence Iraq was involved in 9-11. Clarke feels strongly that the US failed to properly deploy troops quickly into Afghanistan in a search and destroy mission. The Taliban and it’s allies were able to slip away to the mountains to regroup, while the US held back it’s forces for an invasion of Iraq instead. The book claims this actually then overstretched the US army, a further mistake was then disbanding the Iraqi army, many of whom did not resist initially the US invasion, pensions were removed, a huge mistake he claims. Now the US had 100,000 trained armed hostile Iraqi fighters ready to go after them. The book though finishes with an apology that 9-11 was allowed to happen. The book makes it pretty clear that president Clinton was a good president who took it all very seriously, any failures Clarke feels is because he was let down by his military and CIA, where as Bush did not treat the threat seriously enough and took the wrong actions after the attack.All in all a pretty good read, partly 1st person account, but also very descriptive and providing lots of context and background information. The book is also very early 2000s, things have changed quite a bit now in the Middle East. Iraq in 2021 is in quite a different state to the country at the time this book was being written.

One of Irene\'s flaws, unfortunately, is stubbornness which borders on the extreme. As intelligent as she is, she frequently acts on impulse and winds up doing what she has been specifically told not to do, often with life-threatening results. Frank Harriman, a homicide detective with La Piernas Police Department, is Irene\'s boyfriend and emotional support system.Jacob Henderson, teenaged son of a district attorney candidate, comes to Irene claiming his father\'s opponent intends to use smear tactics and claim he is involved in a Satanic cult. A photograph was taken of the boy at a coven gathering, but he was there to convince a young girl, his friend Gethsemane (Sammy), to leave with him. Irene talks to the troubled girl, who substantiates Jacob\'s story. She tells the reporter that the cult is Wiccan, not Satanist. There are disturbing signs of cult activity in town, most of which seem to have a connection to a local runway shelter, which is sponsored by Frank\'s neighbor and dear friend, 80 year-old Althea Fremont. That same evening, Halloween, Mrs. Fremont is murdered and Satanic ritual symbols are left on her door. Irene begins to suspect there is more to this coven than meets the eye. Then Sammy disappears and a human heart is left on Irene\'s doorstep. Danger to Irene escalates when there are no indications she will back-off the case. This is a darker, edgier novel then the previous one, with some grim, brutal torture scenes. To come out of this alive, Irene will have to face-down the devil.""Sweet Dreams, Irene"" is non-stop drama, thrills and chills.

They are both fascinating, well developed characters and the chemistry between them is electric. As usual, Ms. Burke surrounds Irene with a number of interesting and memorable friends and family members, characters who add to the depth and richness of the novel. Our heroine does less investigating than usual here, and, more or less, stumbles into trouble and onto clues rather than initiating the action.

Like the corona in todays environment where public gathering is restricted, the plague was there at his time and theatres ( where the plays were enacted ) were restricted, hence, he turned to poetry!.Deaths in public execution and even child birth ( how uncertified midwifery carried on) are well depicted.

It is a very well researched book and an amalgamation of science with the arts..Its been an interesting non fiction read for me and being a die hard Shakespeare fan and a scientist myself this book made a mark in my reading history I must say.

Did Cleopatra's snakebite seem as easy as it was portrayed? We see how each and every death would actually play out in real world.I liked how the book starts with explaination the idea of death in the Shakespeare's time. The era was all about plague, public executions and the audiance at that time actually witnessed the same in reality. Shakespeare actually had 74 different ways of making his characters die all across his plays.We see author backing up each and every way of death with scientific knowledge and learnings. It can be clearly seen that author has done a hell amount of study and research behind this. I liked how we get an appendix at the end to show us all his plays and death's in a concise manner.The book is going to amuse you and also provide you with new information on Shakespeare's plays as well as on London at that point of time. We see how women were treated, birth of children, living, etc. We also get to see little bit of life background of William Shakespeare himself in the start.Now, do we really need to read all of the Shakespeare's plays and works in order to read this book?

She claims to have reread and reread the books before she wrote. But clearly not. As she thinks Pa drinks mostly coffee. When in fact, when it was cold and he had been working, (as she describes!) he loved, ‘fragrant tea.’ (By Shores of Silver Lake) The story tries to hard to be like the little house books and misses it by a wide mark. The conversations are stilted. Ma never called Her children ‘Dear’ in any of the books. But always by their name. There is no mention what so ever in any of Laura’s books of Carrie being called buttercup. Laura going into a male bedroom to retrieve a stolen toy? Are you joking? In that era? Never. And neither would Ma or Pa have let her anywhere near male boys rooms! Mary laughing because the bullies got really ill? Mary would not have done that. Laura, in her own words may have felt a ‘mean bit of gladness’ but even here I am not sure. Disease was not something to be laughed at, unlike Nellie’s leeches, which are a different thing altogether.The death of baby Freddie. Hummmmm. I am unsure whether Laura ever wanted this told. Although it is tastefully done. It reads rushed. Not enough about living with the ‘double cousins.’ So much to get into here. And it’s wasted by not being written. Also Laura and Mary helping in the hotel? Considering Laura later herself was told in Silver lake to ‘take in the latch and go upstairs to obey, not to come down till Ma told her.’ When there were men in the house. And in little town Ma actually forbids Laura out right hotel work! And Pa states not over his dead body! So absolutely no research here either! Certain thinks have a ring of truth. The visit by the posh ladies, who love the peace of Ma’s home. The passion Laura has of books? Considering much later she hates teaching school with the two little girls at home?All thro we read of Laura’s inner battle she so hated teaching!  I think not. Laura loved being out doors. And only appreciated school life late. This is so badly researched it is painful. The author tells us how she loved the food she researched, but fails to put it into the book! Ma touching other people’s property? I don’t think so. Most of this just does not sit right. This had so much promise. And failed on all counts. I hope someone else re writes it. The conversations, details, happenings everything falls far short. And does not feel or read like Laura’s own. Really disappointed. The books on Caroline years read just like the real thing. Not this. I wouldn’t bother.', 'I recently came across this book, although I forget now what I was looking up at the time. I’ve read as many spin off series of Little House that I can, as some of them are very rare/out of print now and can go for ridiculous amounts of money. Unfortunately, this one also has a preview in the back to “Nellie Oleson Meets Laura Ingalls” by Heather Williams - which is going for crazy amounts on all the usual sites.This covers the forgotten/missing period of time from the original series of books, which I have read and loved since I was a child. This fits neatly between “On The Banks of Plum Creek” and “By The Shores of Silver Lake”, the fourth and fifth books respectively. In reality, Laura had only written 12 pages about this period of time, some of which was briefly touched upon in the TV show. This covers the Ingalls running a hotel (in the TV show, I reckon this would tie in to them meeting Albert for the first time) and also losing Laura’s baby brother, Charles Frederick. It wasn’t a particularly good period for the family, however I’m not sure why it was never written up as a full length book by Laura. Perhaps because there wasn’t much that actually happens, and they seem to spend most of the time unpacking/packing, hopping from place to place.The author does a good job of sticking to the tone and formula of the original series, although I’m sure I could start picking holes, had I read the original series closer to reading this. It’s relatively short, as the actual story only goes up to page 163, with some additional extras at the end - a recipe for mashed potatoes anyone?! There was just something missing - whether endless re-runs of the TV show have coloured my view of the books now, but there was just something missing for me, which I didn’t find with the original series of books.I still have my mum’s copies of the books, with the covers illustrated by Garth Williams, so there’s something about these re-releases/spin offs, which I feel a little resentful towards. The little girls on the front of this book, one is presumably supposed to be Laura but as for the redhead - who is that supposed to be, Anne Shirley? This is probably meant to be her friend, Alice, who gets mentioned towards the end of the book, since they’re holding kittens. I’ve grown up with the illustrations and even on the Caroline/Rose spin offs, most of them had similar illustrations/covers, rather than these models posing.The book also comes with some extras. There’s a 3 page biography of Laura, a Q&A with the author, a “Travelling by covered wagon” history, the mashed potatoes recipe, the lyrics to “The Star Spangled Banner” and the very short preview to the Nellie Oleson spin off book. (I’m still annoyed about the price that this is going for.)If you’re a fan of Little House On The Prairie, or just a completist of anything related, this is worth getting, to expand the book series. I would probably say that it’s not necessary though, and certainly not worth paying a lot for.', ""Good book, nearly matches style of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

And also its a story that treads on the lines of marriage, death, ambition, solitude, compassion, determination, which only take the story of love forward.I am someone who reads next to none romance fiction. And after reading this great book about love, I decided that i cannot read anything else about love or romance or affairs or any relationship, for i might expect this magical and eternal and intense from every book and i am sure i'd be disappointed more often than not.For someone - like me - who likes to read any book that comes in their way to get entertained, this book is a revelation that there was books that not only entertain but also make you breath heavy, take deep breaths; make you smile and laugh and shock you; put you in a dilemma of sorts in the matters of love, and also, more often throughout the book, a lot of times, it made my heart bulge like a balloon. I could feel it becoming heavy with intense emotion.Whatever i might say about the book itself will be in vain, so i am just refraining myself from talking anything about the story or the characters. Its just the words, God, words of Marquez that bring all the greatness and glory to the story, and make it extraordinary.I've had amazing moments while reading this book. Pick it up and have an explosion.""]";There are novels, like journeys, which you never want to end: this is one of them. LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is one of the most uplifting romances of our times.

Quelques années plus tard, nous sommes en 1933,  on retrouve Jean, le narrateur.  Il a dix huit ans et  séjourne pendant les vacances chez son oncle Félicien Ladourd, dirigeant d’une fabrique  d’objets de piété, la Santima,  dont Jacques Rezeau est un des actionnaires. Une paix rêvée ! Mais à présent bachelier, Jean doit songer à une carrière dans le droit.  Sa mère ne peut évidemment pas l’abandonner plus longtemps à d’incertains contrôles et aux fantaisies de son inspiration, éventuellement sentimentale quand on sait que la famille Ladourd a sept enfants, un garçon l’aîné  et surtout six filles. À dix huit ans, Jean n’a jamais eu d’intimité qu’avec lui-même, et ses proches n’ont jamais été pour lui que des commensaux. Il ne s’est lié avec personne durant les années de collège.  La maison de son oncle Félicien avec ses six filles a tout  d’un gynécée pour Jean qui tarde à faire son choix.  Les parents sont encore en Guadeloupe où son père a été nommé. La vie est belle ! Jean parmi les six jouvencelles a enfin sa préférée : l’aînée bien sûre, la ravissante Michelle, dix neuf ans, fine et la poitrine palpitante vouée à la romance…  Mais des années de haine n’ont guère préparé Jean à l’amour et l’apprentissage du bonheur et de la liberté pour échapper à l’oppression familiale est difficile. Le droit de plus  ne l’intéresse pas vraiment  et s’il ne tenait qu’à lui, il irait séance tenante revendre ses bouquins  et partirait trouver du travail à Paris. S’esbigner pour avoir mauvaise conscience n’est pas son style finalement et il se demande pourquoi faut-il si longtemps exister avant de vivre, demander avant de prendre et recevoir avant de donner.  Ses parents lui refusant tout argent de poche, Jean a trouvé des petits boulots en dehors de ses heures de cours de droit afin de pourvoir à ce besoin qu’il a de vivre, et notamment à la Santima chez Félicien son oncle. Quand il a un moment, il rend visite à Michelle. Mais la Vieille veille et ne peut supporter de voir Jean s’accorder tant de liberté, et menace : il devra quitter la chambre de Mme Poli et rentrer en internat avec la discipline inhérente, et également cesser le travail chez Félicien et toute visite à Michelle. Sur ce, toute affaire cessante, Jean fait sa valise en un rien de temps, ne pouvant supporter plus longtemps de voir sa mère craindre son bonheur après l’avoir forcé à faire du droit, et désirer uniquement sa insoumission pour en tirer un argument pour l’éliminer, rendre ses études précaires et son avenir incertain. À présent il apparaît à Jean qu’il est moins urgent de combattre la Vieille que de la rendre à l’impuissance par un bonheur qui  puisse l’offenser. La dernière arme de sa mère plus tard sera la médisance, car la calomnie est la dernière ressource de l’impuissance.  Parti à Paris,  il va aller d’emplois précaires en petits travaux tout en étudiant. Les rencontres féminines se succèdent après la rupture minable avec Michelle. Ce sera notamment Emma une brève rencontre au 7e étage de sa pension,  et durant deux ans une vie de l’importe quoi avec d’innombrables  n’importe qui. Puis Paule Leconidec,  sa voisine de pallier, telle une  vraie mère enfin pour lui, d’une grande tendresse, certes équivoque,  une partenaire plus très jeune mais d’une grande âme devenue pure à force d’être gratitude.  Puis ce sera  Monique, l’unique, au sourire venu de très loin qui lui suffit pour dire bonjour, qui ne parle pas beaucoup, une vertu si rare chez les femmes pense Jean. Jean qui a connu la haine et qui découvre l’amour songe alors que si la haine est un combat, l’amour est un pacte tout en ayant les apparences d’un combat. Il la connaît à peine cette inconnue et  bénit le hasard qui la lui a donnée mais qui peut la lui reprendre. Il se demande comment il se fait qu’il tienne si fort à cette étrangère et constate avec bonheur qu’au pied de leur intimité, il n’y a pas cette épaisseur de vieille vie, ces détritus  d’histoire commune, ce terreau des familles qui rend vivaces les plus belles comme les plus atroces végétations de sentiments. Monique  lui offre ses petites manies, ses péchés véniels, ses quarts de silence, son déshabillage éclair et son petit sein dur… Ils s’entendent bien, ils s’aiment. Certes les hommes sont jaloux du passé alors que les femmes le sont du présent : un homme préfère être le premier amour d’une femme tandis qu’une femme préfère être le dernier amour d’un homme. Monique était sans passé. Tout va bien.  Mariage de Jean et de Monique,  deuil de  Jacques Rezeau et l’ultime querelle à quatre pour l’héritage : Folcoche, Marcel le préféré de sa mère et le secret de sa filiation, Fred et Jean vont s’affronter  une dernière fois : les derniers chapitres sont  hallucinants de haine et la magnifique exécration que Jean a de tout temps voué  à sa mère touche à son paroxysme. Les dernières salves échangées entre Jean et sa mère atteignent des sommets de détestation.  Et Jean de conclure quand sa mère s’en va : « Ô ma jeunesse, je ne t’invoquerai plus. Tu ne t’effaces pas, tu t’estompes comme cette femme qui n’est plus qu’un point noir au bout de la rue, qui lutte contre une rafale et qui semble emporter l’hiver avec elle. »  Un chef d’œuvre au style acide mais  sublime, une analyse d’une cruauté rare. Un réquisitoire contre l’oppression familiale.', 'Semblable à lui-même, le révolté Jean fuit la ville où il est étudiant après que Folcoche sa mère l\'a calomnié et calomonié son logeur qu\'elle accuse d\'avoir favorisé une amourette avec l\'une de ses filles.Jean va se débrouiller seul à Paris, menant d front études et petits boulots, voguant d\'amourettes en amourettes....grâce au soutien d\'une autre Paule, pas sa mère (""Paule Nord"") mais sa maitresse  plus âgée ( Paule Sud"") aussi aimante et généreuse que Folcoche est froide et radin.A la fin du roman Jean rencontre une jeune fille orpheline de son âge, lui qui est orphelin d\'une famille aimante et il fonde sa propre famille grâce à un don de Paule qui s\'efface avec noblesse. Il connaitra la joie d\'avoir un fils. Excellente suite de ""Vipère au poing"".']";

Saranya (Saranya Umakanthan)Format: PaperbackNo of Pages: 234Publisher: Writing Geeks (1st Ed- 25/09/2018)Blurb: The blurb portion of the book is written broadly while giving a clear idea about the plot and keeping the storyline under the cover. It is sufficient revealing and that’s why I consider this good and apt.Cover: The front cover of the book is interesting & catchy one I can say. Though it could have been better, but as per the base plot of the book, the way it is designed, can surely be termed as ‘justified’.Title: The title of the book is good and highly inspiring I must say. It goes with the theme of the story perfectly. Hence I consider it appropriate for the book.Language & narration: Language of the book is simple and lucid enough to comprehend. There are quite a few places where, the choice of classic words has impressed me often. The story is in 3rd person narrative and the narrating style of the author kept the charm of the book intact till the end. By continuing a plain and simple flow, descriptive narration of the events made the story more connecting to the reader.Plot: This plot has all sorts of elements present, that is needed to develop an inspirational and love story full of motivation. Be it in any aspect, whether it is friendship or family love, it covered every zone and perfectly woven. The main plot is consists of several sub plots too that added cherishing flavor to the story I must say. I will add that there were some places where the plot seemed a bit cliché; it could have been avoided, but overall it is good undoubtedly.Setting: Setting of the story is in Bangalore & Chennai.Characterization: Crystal clear characterization is can be considered as one of the strengths of the book. Each and every character (be it the protagonists or any other supporting) is portrayed visibly clear and all of them are justified to their respective roles till the end. Names of the characters mentioned in the book are- Samaira Ranjan aka Sami, Ashish, Ram, Pariti, Sharmi, Pooja, Vivian Andhera aka Viv, Mr. Sadana, Raghu, Radha, Kushi Vastav, Mr. Ravi, Mr. Vadra, Preeti, Shreya, Praveen, Amar, Dinesh, Guna, Anu, Lakshmi Antie, Vijay, Gauri Andhera, Amitesh Andhera, Pavi, Kavita Ma, Arpit, Baijan, Chitra, Mr. Dasgupta, Bala, Shiv, Laila.Theme: Love, Romance, Friendship, Family Value, Life, Inspirational, Motivational.Story in a nutshell: The story revolves around the lives of two persons and people their surroundings. They are- Samaira and Vivian. Here we go-Samaira was a girl with full of enthusiasm and life. She was not just only the head turner during her college times, but her charming and jolly personality made her adorable and popular in every aspect once. Singing was in her soul and she used to live music through her. Life was quite fare to her till a certain point. But the scenario started to change after his marriage. At a very young age, she faced the cruel side of life through her husband and mother-in-law. After inexplicable humiliations and insult, when she finally was able to get the divorce and thought that life couldn’t be more pathetic, right that moment life threw a much harder stone at her, that was beyond her wildest dreams. Life snatched her parents and brother and made ‘society’ think that she is responsible for that.After losing everything and every single reason to live, when she was completely scattered and broken into pieces from inside out, right that moment, Vivian crossed her path. Vivian was one of the most successful businessman and entrepreneur and the boss of the company ‘Creative Tanks’ aka CT. He was ambitious, determined and he was that type of Man that every girl dreams of. His handsome look, sharp business sense, achieving will, gentle and caring nature and focused behavior and huge success at an early stage made him the most lovable and attractive personality in his surroundings. Vivian had fallen head over hills for Samaira on their first meeting, and it was definitely love at first sight from his side. Destiny brought them together when Samaira joined CT in Ideas Dept of Marketing. In spite of being in Boss-Employee relationship, there was much deeper bonding between them.Vivian already casted his dynamic magic over her and she started realizing it too. But she made herself realize that love was not her cup of tea. Her experience with love already did cost her enough and she won’t allow it to affect her anymore. That’s why she made it very clear to him that she has only friendship to offer him, nothing more than that…But she was not the Samaira she used to be once, and Vivian wanted to break her shell and brought back the old carefree Samira. He wanted to wipe away all her tears and give her all the happiness and love she deserved. Eventually Samira got to know such a truth about Vivian’s past that shook her to the core...What is awaiting their destiny? What was the truth about Vivian’s past that Samaira discovered? Was that the end of the pain that life had to offer or destiny has something else in store for them? Will Vivian be successful to give her the life she meant to get? Will he be able to break her shells and bring her back? Will she ever accept her true feelings about him? Will they ever be able to stay together? To get these answers and to know the rest of the story, grab your copy of the book now and dive in.My Verdict: Authoress Saranya Umakanthan has penned down a touching and inspirational lovely journey indeed. Mixed emotions overpowered me while reading. Smile & tears, it can bring both to the reader’s face and I am sure it will. Life is not a cakewalk for everyone every time; it can’t be. Life has a tendency to throw stones to us when we least expected to, because it wants to see how strong we are. There can be any kind of pain, struggle, loss, sacrifice, and life can make us face anything; it is all about whether we let ourselves down and quit or face them and overcome everything. To achieve something, first we have to believe that we can. God never gives us such pain that we won’t be able to handle. All we need a little push to see beyond the wall and think positively. Love is the most beautiful feeling ever created by God in this world and true love can conquer anything. God never promised us an easy journey but only a safe arrival. True love is worth waiting for and any sacrifices.The pain, struggle, inner fights, dilemma, friendship, genuine bonding, pure and innocent soulful love, care, affection, family love and value, smile, laugh, ambitions, dreams, possessiveness, jealousy, maturity, sacrifice, joy, supportive nature and phases of being in love- each and every thing mentioned above and every shade of emotions are evidently clear in every line of this story from beginning till the end. Each chapter is started with some line of anecdotes from the author and that concludes a very significant message for every chapter. Non- English words are pointed, written in italic fonts and meanings are given at the page end, separately. I cherished reading this book overall certainly.At the end of the day, we have to believe that we can, only then we will and of course we must…Recommendation: I’d like to recommend this lovely book to every avid reader & to every love reader, romance lover, and to the people who loves to read motivational journeys. It is definitely an inspiring one for them.

And if she falls, he will be there to catch her, lift her, and push her again until she flies to stars…” Love…does it mean going around the trees in Switzerland, singing tra-la-la-la in the snow? Is it chanting “I love you” mantra a thousand times a day? Is it about gifting teddies and roses to your partner? Or is it bombarding each other with a thousand and one pings in Messenger from morning till night? Life batters Samaira. Stuck to these clichés, she loses everything…her love, parents, and wealth. Hopeless, she collides against the dynamic boss of Creative Tanks (CT), Vivian, who basically holds great contempt for losers. He aims to be the top entrepreneur in India, whereas Samaira has not even a notion of her dreams. Fate plays its own game when she goes in search of work, where she encounters him again. An air of mystery surrounds her, which tugs at him. Despite being opposites, sparks fly, and they are attracted. Vivian is perfect, but she vows that she will never fall in love again. He reaches a point where he would do just about anything to bring back the smile on her face. The chase begins. She keeps running away…from love, hope, and aspirations, and he keeps trying to bring her back on track. Thus their journey begins from the end, with oodles of inspiration and love… Vivian breaks Samaira’s shell and guides her into pursuing her broken dreams. He promises that he will be there for her if life pulls her down and hold her tight when she needs support. Together, they vow to each other, “We can. We will. We must.” But when Vivian tumbles and it is Samaira’s turn to break his fall, will she catch him? Walking on the arduous path of life, will they climb the ladder of success together or crash and burn? Can love be enough of a catalyst to attain their dreams? And now life threatened not to throw just lemons but huge melons…""Review-""WE CAN, WE WILL, WE MUST"" by author Saranya Umakanthan is an romantic fiction novel.

This book spins three years after Mia\'s accident and with Adam\'s POV who is a big rockstar in LA whereas Mia is finishing her graduation in Julliard. Not only that, we get to know who Adam really is and who he was when he met Mia for the first time.Synopsis:If you had a second chance at first love ...would you take it? It\'s been three years since Adam\'s love saved Mia after the accident that annihilated life as she knew it ...and three years since Mia walked out of Adam\'s life forever. Now living on opposite coasts, Mia is Julliard\'s rising star and Adam is LA tabloid fodder, thanks to his new rock star status and celebrity girlfriend. When Adam gets stuck in New York by himself, chance brings the couple together again, for one last night. As they explore the city that has become Mia\'s home, Adam and Mia revisit the past and open their hearts to the future - and each other. Told from Adam\'s point of view in the spare, powerful prose that defined If I Stay, Where She Went explores the devastation of grief, the promise of new hope, and the flame of rekindled romance.Three years after Mia\'s accident that killed her parents and her younger brother, Mia is in New York, finishing her school in Julliard. And she has broken up with Adam without any explanation. Adam is now a famous rockstar in LA, and is in a live-in relationship with a famous celebrity, Bryn. But Adam cannot forget Mia, and his sudden trip to New York leaves him face-to-face with the ghost of his past, Mia. Mia immediately asks Adam to come along on a New York tour before they both leave for tour. But will Adam be able to keep his undying feelings for Mia under control, who has changed so much since the accident? What was the reason that made Mia break up with Adam? This is the finale of Adam and Mia\'s story, of how one night into Mia\'s favorite places in the New York City gives birth to their hidden and lost love for one another. Read this final book to once again fall in love with Mia and Adam.I cried for Adam, I felt resentment towards Mia, I felt excited for Adam and finally I felt really happy for both Mia and Adam. And all thanks to Gayle Forman, for justifying and putting a really beautiful and satisfying end to her story of Mia and Adam. Honestly, Mia\'s story is heart-breaking and sad, but the love for family is highlighted in the first book, whereas in this book, Adam\'s irrevocable love for Mia is so true that it is evident from his POV, as everything he does, it is somehow connected to Mia. Even though Mia broke up with Adam with no explanation, he could never hate her. All the while I felt like reaching out to Adam and hugging him tightly.The writing is beautiful and laced with deep and painful emotions, the kind of feeling you will get if you have that ""the one that got away"" in your life. The narrative is nostalgic and evocative and flows freely. The story is engrossing as there is so much drama behind Adam\'s band members that kept me turning the pages till the end. There are some beautiful moments between Adam and Mia, written with so much passion and feels that I cherished them even after the end of the book. The pacing is really fast, as the story instantly pulled me into its depth.The characters are once again so well-developed and this time, the limelight is on Adam, who is a gem and I bet girls would kill to be with him. He is the most understanding person, who let Mia go from his life as he vowed when Mia was in the coma. And despite of so much glitters, money, cheering, Adam is not happy in his new life and that is happy from the opening sentence of the book that says that how he wants to get through a 24 hours in a day. Mia seemed bit mature and laid back but Mia was not that striking person who was once three years ago. There are some new characters and some old characters, that are well-built and keeps the story interesting.Overall, this short ending finale to Mia and Adam\'s love story is fascinating yet poignant. The love depicted between Adam and Mia is pure and with lots of hidden passion that made me fall in love yet all over again and it definitely moved me a lot. Their love is captured with realism, challenges, struggles and resolution and promises. It is amazing to feel that kind of love. Do read this book before the movie rolls in.I hear the movie adaption of this book is under shooting starring Jamie Blackley as Adam, and I really can\'t wait to see this movie, which I bet will be another major hit.', ""I'm in love with this book 🤗 the book was awesome I don't want to give spoiler please read it."", ""This book is even better than its prequel i.e. 'If I Stay'.I loved the narration and the story from Adam's perspective.Beautifully explained. Can feel the pain and aggression of Adam's after Mia left him.The story runs in parallel and chapters alternatively describes the present where Adam meet Mia along with the past events from Adam's perspective after Mia met the accident.PS: Read 'If I stay' before reading this book:\nIf I Stay""]";The stunning sequel to Gayle Forman's international best seller, If I Stay - Now a major film starring Chloe Grace Moretz.If you had a second chance at first love . . . would you take it?It's been three years since Mia walked out of Adam’s life. And three years he’s spent wondering why. When their paths cross again in New York, Adam and Mia are brought back together for one life-changing night.Perfect for fans of John Green and David Levithan, Where She Went explores the devastation of grief, the promise of new hope, and the flame of rekindled romance.

While the Divers are going through a rollercoaster ride of changes all other characters around them remains the same & hence it becomes hard as a reader to feel for them & tough to slog through the part where Divers are not there, good writing can only take you so far.Overall I really enjoyed the details Fitzgerald goes into flesh out the Divers but the rest of the supporting characters seems to be just not there."", 'Below average quality of cover and pages.']";Amory Blaine, intent on rebelling against his staid, Midwestern upbringing, longs to acquire the patina of Eastern sophistication.

You are left numb with emotional stasis at the end.', 'My 3rd reading of this masterpiece written with irony and finesse. The eternal story of Emma Bovary and her broken dreams is heartbreaking every time.The narration is actually quite modern in that the perspective changes quite often from a mysterious first person in the beginning (a schoolmate of Charles Bovary?) to the interior monologues of Charles, Emma, Léon, and Rodolphe. The descriptions of the various locations in the book are always surprising with tiny references to the principle characters. It may surprise you to know that this book, which is essentially a tragedy, also is full of humor and sarcasm. For example, when Léon and Emma have a rendez-vous in the Cathedral of Rouen, the Swiss guard who tries to give them a tour of the church while Léon is freaking out and wants to get out of there while Emma pretends to be interested because she is not quite sold on the seduction is pure genius. In a similar, if more romantic vein, the whispered conversation of Rodolphe and Emma in the lodge as the vice-Prefect gives the world\'s most boring speech (his boss couldn\'t be bothered to come) was extraordinary. Every word in Flaubert is measured and perfectly weighted to each situation, the original French is absolutely splendid - whether he is describing the pretentious conversation of M. Homais or the various season and their impact on the moods of the characters and tone of the novel. The only criticism that I can bring is that the denouement is a bit long - that being said, there is another fantastic ironic payoff in the last sentence.This book from 1856 is of course a product of the Romantic period in culture but it surpasses most of its contemporaries by its precise psychology - both of men and women, its irony, its subtle criticism of the ""petit bourgeois"" and French society, and the meticulous observation of detail. Even 161 years later, it remains a monument of literature and a summit of free expression (Flaubert was pursued in court and beat the censors.)', ""Edition is fine.

Perhaps because it is filled with gruesome imagery. That should be one of the reasons why it stands out as a unique epic.

Some of them are attracted to the benevolent Mother Abigail in Boulder, while the rest are forced to join Randall Flagg in Vegas. Flagg is mentioned to be an immortal being, an inhuman. Mother Abigail portrays hope and goodness within, whereas Flagg is the embodiment of evil in its purest form.Then again, there is the multitude of characters. What worries me most about reading epics is understanding each of them simultaneously. But that turned out to be real easy. Partly because each of them is unlike any other. Partly because none of them turned out to be disappointing.Unlike other dark stories, this one makes the reader feel pity for the antagonists as well, as and when they find themselves in a dire quicksand. For this particular achievement, Stephen King deserves much more than awards.Concerning the monstrosity of the book, don\'t worry about it. When King archives immersion, he will make sure that the reader doesn\'t feel time as well. But there is one thing to be worried about. It is by far the most disturbing story I\'ve read.

Well-drawn, intriguing characters abound here, including Tripp’s gay publishing friend, Terry Crabtree, and the two loves of Grady’s life, estranged wife Emily and his lover and married college chancellor, Sara Gaskell.  With Wonder Boys Chabon is operating on a smaller, more intimate, scale than (arguably) his piece-de-resistance The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay or the recent, more oblique, but highly inventive, Moonglow.  Indeed, I would liken Chabon’s style and character portrayal here to the likes of Richard Russo and Richard Ford who, as two of the finest recent American writers evoking small-town life in modern-day USA, can be no bad thing.'];Grady Tripp is a pot-smoking middle aged novelist who has stalled on a 2611 page opus titled Wonder Boys.

Both desire more from life and to leave the drug business, but they don't know how to get there.\xa0I felt I could readily relate to the characters and would like to learn more about them.Overall, I'd recommend it, but don't expect anything more than casual leisure read from it."", 'The Elephant Tree glows, both literally in the story and as a story itself. It is only accentuated further by the dark travails of a drug dealer that the story centres upon. The pace is reasonably quick and the tone embedded deep within the contours of that streetside bar. And with that begins the story’s uniqueness.Authors mould their inspiration and ideas to yield stories of every genre and walks of life. Yet, at most times, they are all limited in their depth by a simple fact - they did not actually live through the tale. This compels the plot to resort to a minutest sense of aloofness in its third person narrative. It is an observation, not an experience, after all. Not so for Mr. Richard. His story leads us on the footpath of a man - Scott - in the thick of con as if we were literally walking right behind him. And thus, the narrative breaks down the first barrier, but keeps us guessing as to the next - the motive.As Scott points out to justify his drug dealing, more people die every year from falling off a horse while horse riding while there are other forms of gradual, invisible murder that we are not even aware of - such as the unknown “stuff in our food” or “mobile phone radiations”. So, really, must we worry about some petty hallucinogen or just enjoy the story? The author gives us the answer, but only after he has made us use our options A, B and C.Mr. Ronald has a way of keeping us warm as he trudges through his story. With much standing on the very edge of our conscience, he knows the importance of his book’s companionship when he reminds us that solitude always leads to retrospective thinking, and if the past is what one is trying to get away from, then constant distractions in the present are needed. But that inevitably leads us to question the nature of present itself. Enter, The Elephant Tree - a bark with faces of an elephant and a man upon it, depending on which side one looks at it from. The metaphor is used here to highlight, inevitably, a good side and a bad side. Which one does which brings out both the fragments of our psyche and the author’s motive. “What is special about the elephants?” one character asks. “Physical and mental strength,” comes the reply.The protagonist is gradually, though teasingly, led into a web that spirals down and away with time. Characters get pulled in, some wither off, others survive. Who is behind the play and with what purpose remains unknown and off our radar. But we witness a continuous reminder of the real addiction that we bear to “ambition” and “growth” - one we often use more as a justification for acts of adrenaline than for reasonable action. So the only way out is not through some mystic twist of fate but through a balanced chain of thought.Like all good mysteries, the story reveals its truth only in the last chapter. But The Elephant Tree does it with a sense of difficult acceptance looming as a hangover due to the constancy of drugged-innuendo that has persisted throughout the novel. And only as you reach the very final third of the final chapter that the story truly reaches its closure - with a sudden and most unexpected lift off that leaves you with hope and strength renewed. Mr. Ronald understands that revelations in a good story are not just about “who did it” or “why” but also about “what it leads to.” Right there is the author’s genius and depth. Right there is the saga’s soul.', 'It was difficult to maintain interest in the beginning but gains momentum in the second half.A light and fast read for a dull day.']";A jagged series of events written with gritty realism.

The author very cleverly shows us the truth, even when Tarquin is saying the complete opposite.  A passage that made me laugh early on was when he said that he has “always disliked being called a genius” and that “It is fascinating to notice how quick people have been to intuit this aversion and avoid using the term”.Keen as I am on food and food writing, I did find some of the long, descriptive passages a bit tiresome and can see how the book might not suit everyone, but as the tension and slow-burning/roasting excitement built towards the end, I would happily have read more, including a sequel or continuing Ripley-like series.Overall, this was a very funny, dark parody of good food and snobbery with a sinister streak of murder peppered throughout.', ""Some reviewers here have complained that this novel is quite slight and unsubstantial. To me, that misses the point - things which are slight and inconsequential can be incredibly enjoyable.Tarquin Wynot, the narrator, is an erudite, snobbish, foodie, psychopathic murderer. Sounds a bit 'Silence of the Lambs'? Not really. Wynot bumps people off for a variety of reasons but never just for fun. His fun he gets from the food and wine he so meticulously describes throughout the novel.Like Tarquin's cooking, the prose is a fanciful, indulgent, and showy. Often fantastically funny, with a swift pace that still takes time for plenty of impressive asides, I found this unputdownable not necessarily because I wanted to know what happened next, but because I was enjoying myself too much. It is the literary equivalent of a meal in a very good but self-consciously experimental restaurant. You may not want to eat there everyday, you may think some of the combinations were a bit over the top, but you have to admit it was dazzling.Finally, it is telling that when Lanchester published 'Capital' to much critical fanfare in 2012, this was the book, despite being his first novel and published in the nineties, that several reviewers held up as the measure of his full abilities. Unfortunately, I don't think he's lived up to the potential of 'The Debt to Pleasure' so far, but then it's a very high standard to have set yourself! If you enjoy 'The Debt to Pleasure', the meatier, more homely 'Mr. Phillips' is not a bad second course."", ""John Lanchester gives us a study in pretentiousness, self-denial and deranged envy that would sit proudly on any psychologist's bookshelves, while keeping the reader gripped in this most unusual novel.Part travelogue, part diary, part recipe book... wholly entertaining. All that and elements of a whodunnit turned on its head make this one of the most interesting books you'll read for a long time.What starts off, apparently, as the snobbish diary of a nobody becomes compelling very quickly in ways the reader certainly doesn't expect. The dark humour is perfectly observed and often laugh-out-loud funny; the meticulously-concocted (and utterly convincing) recipes make for mouth-watering platforms of action and opinionated soap-boxing by the main character; the hints at a murky past leave you curious to find out just what is going on as Tarquin Winot travels south on what appears to be some sort of quest; the plot drives forward through unconventional means until you're utterly engaged by the insane thoughts of one of modern fiction's most devilishly intriguing creations.The Debt To Pleasure is not a conventional novel. The narrative does not develop along conventional lines. The fascination is not always for what happens next but rather for what is going on in Tarquin Winot's mind, and how to unravel his deluded understanding of his past, his relationship to those around him and his philosophy of life from what might, by the rest of us, be called 'the truth'. The story is written in the first-person, and that person is clearly bonkers.An easy read, it works on many levels, entertaining, enthralling and inviting us into the mind of a man who can't distinguish invention from reality, or even right from wrong. The past, desires, hatred, envy, unfulfilled ambition, sibling rivalry and the amorality of a psychopath are used like ingredients in a dish that leaves you with a very satisfying aftertaste.""]";Winner of the Whitbread Award for Best First Novel and a New York Times Notable Book, John Lanchester's The Debt to Pleasure is a wickedly funny ode to food. Traveling from Portsmouth to the south of France, Tarquin Winot, the book's snobbish narrator, instructs us in his philosophy on everything from the erotics of dislike to the psychology of the menu. Under the guise of completing a cookbook, Winot is in fact on a much more sinister mission that only gradually comes to light.  Read more

From their rampant empire building, their obsession with engineering projects, to their puritanical streak when dealing with moral issues, the Victorians could never be accused of being dull.The common cliché of Victorian society is a rigid hierarchy, an adherence to Christianity and a zeal for moral observance in all walks of life.Hence, the pendulum swings from one extreme (the crusade to outlaw child labour) at home, to another abroad (the demands for the British government to implement direct rule in India after the mutiny.)Such a society has invariably, produced a rich seam of literature. From Dracula to HG Wells, from Kipling to Conrad.Conrad, the outsider, is well placed to present a snapshot of Victorian society. From chronicling imperialism's logical conclusion in The Heart of Darkness, to portraying the seedy underbelly of London society in The Secret Agent.The fear of foreigners, of anarchists threatening the established order, was the Victorian's bête noir, and Conrad does an admirable job of capturing the flavour of that moral panic.Although at times the prose may be dense (understandable as English wasn't Conrad's mother tongue) Conrad succeeds in giving us an intriguing, suspenseful story."", ""This book was nothing like I expected.

I think the novel is deficient in not adequately explaining the nature of the evil practised by the occult sect. In places, there is perhaps too much complexity of examination of motives, possible consequences etc. The strength of the work is in the ways in which Christianity can help people in trouble to heal the fragmentation of personality which life in the modern world so often causes. Each book and each chapter has its quotation from an archbishop (Habgood) and divinity professor (Ford), a Howatch feature that is invaluable, for the statements are profound and personally helpful to anyone interested in maximising himself as an agent for good in the world. Susan's own religious experience is important, one imagines. The unseen companion who appears, the presence of the deity, when praying; the effect of the integrating force of love. It may be tempting to try to account for the effect of the sense of the other in terms which are more materialistic, more scientific, but she describes this kind of thing so well that one is, in effect, being educated in spirituality. No mean feat in a novel about a world that has all but given up religion, so one might think.  The idea that one can sense the effect of others praying for one is interesting.

I don't know why this book was chosen. Was it because it was the oldest author among the nominees as the list is being advertised? Or were the judges really as smitten by the book as I was lost with it? I don't know that yet but I'd really like to know it, at some point. Despite its shortness, I found the story an unnecessary drag filled with wordplay that after a point stops interesting the reader in me, frankly. The premise sounded interesting and I was overjoyed to see that a book has been nominated where the central character, Joseph Coppock, is a child. He is struggling with loneliness and a problem in one of his eyes when Treacle Walker appears at his doorstep offering him anything he wants from his chest in exchange for a rag and bone. Exploration of childhood is one of my favourite themes in any work of fiction. If it has good reviews, and/or recommendations from a trusted reader, I am game. I don't think twice and gobble it up. The same happened with this, and unfortunately, I am afraid to say the execution never worked out for me. After reading the book, I was curious about what reviewers and critics have had to say on it. I found Speller's review on Strange Horizon to be the most sound and interesting of the lot. This was the first book I read of Garner and the first review I read of Speller; I am happy to say I will be looking forward to reading more of Speller for analysing a text with so much thought, precision and care. She writes, '..this particular text is that it is trying very hard, possibly too hard, to do several things, not the least of which is to be an Alan Garner novel. However, its considerable ambition is not always matched by its execution, to the point where, at times, it is opaque..' Further on she notes, 'To fully achieve its effect, the text requires the reader to be more than an average reader, though even extremely knowledgeable readers are struggling with it. This is not reading as a collaborative effort so much as reading as a full-time research project, and that is not how people generally read. Which feels like another kind of gatekeeping to me.' Again, I say, the book had a great premise and characters that were truly enticing; from Joe, Treacle Walker to Thin Amren; I was looking forward to seeing them, being with them, feeling all that they did but that never happened, sadly. I will end this review of a rant here. Maybe read it and come up with something else than this? I will certainly be looking to read that then."", ""I have read other books by Alan Garner, after being enchanted by Elidor as a child. I admit I have not read all of his works, but the high praise heaped by reviewers on this one lured me into buying it. Probably a mistake.First of all it's a very quick read - 30 minutes to an hour at most.There are a lot of ancient words, mostly references from old folklore and to things from a little known play written and performed years ago. I only know this because I was googling them as I read. (Perhaps some explanatory footnotes might have helped).  No doubt very highly educated and well read readers won't need to google, as they will understand and appreciate the references, and get the most out of it. (Which probably explains the glowing reviews).But for me, it felt like I was being held at arm's length by the author.  I had the feeling that there was a deeper meaning to the book, but my hope, as I read, of it being revealed or dawning on me were in vain.There wasn't much of a story, and what with the opaque references and language, I couldn't engage with this book. I finished it with a feeling of 'Is that it?'I might read it again, in case I missed something first time round, but right now I am very disappointed by it."", 'I was slow coming to Alan Garner, as an adult training to be a teacher. I was hooked and bowled over from the start.I was lucky to be able to enjoy some of these books with my classes at a middle school. I hope they have not forgotten Alderley Edge or The Owl Service. I will never forget my first reading of Red Shift on a train from Leeds to Wareham or the second reading when we got there!Treacle Walker is a strange tale and a compelling one. If you are a Garner fan it should be right up your street. It would make an excellent introduction to his books, full of surprises, beautifully written and with a beating heart.']";'Playful, moving and wholly remarkable' Guardian 'A small miracle' New Statesman 'Mastery of craft, resonance and deep feeling on every page' Telegraph  Read more

In the end I have come down on the positive side and hence the 4 star rating, but let's get the gripes out of the way first. Language and grammar are meant to combine as the art of communication, so why try and turn the reading of a book into a puzzle? Is it some sort of macho thing that persuades authors to abandon norms? The absence of quotation marks in a book which contained a not inconsiderable amount of dialogue, did NOT enhance the reading of the book. Was this meant to give the appearance of modernity? All I know is that I was often re-reading passages just to check who had been saying what to whom, which was frustrating bearing in mind the emotional intensity the exchanges were conveying. Note to the editor, it is not clever to put obstacles in the way of the reader, the book was wonderful in so many other ways why detract from that enjoyment?The second gripe was also a part of the book's strength. The language was just beautiful. The descriptions of the landscape of Western Australia were superb and the prose poetic and lyrical. The tastes, smells and colours of the country were a huge part of the book and perhaps its greatest strength; John Steinbeck would have been proud of the sense of place imparted by Tim Winton's writing. The increasing emotional turmoil of Lu Fox as he headed away from White Point into the wilds and the physical privations he put himself through were as painful as raw nerve endings. My complaint though, is that this section went on far too long and became meandering, such that the narrative lost momentum significantly and was only regained in the last 30 or 40 pages or so. And then it was finished off too quickly.Frustrations apart, I really enjoyed my first taste of Tim Winton and I have Cloudstreet lined for my next."", ""Read this book in advance of the R4 book club recording with the author. It's driven by an incredibly strong sense of place - one of the most extreme I've read - and the three main characters who push the plot along between them.It's worth reading for the descriptions of the WA coastline alone plus the Ozzy terminology of billies and swag etc - very colourful.The three characters are all very damaged by lack of love, loss and alcohol - but what is the novel about? Some say it's Georgie's love for Lu but I think it's just as much about redemption - Jim Buckridge is not a good man but tries to do the right thing even if it is against his nature. You do wonder at the nastiness behind the idyllic setting of White Point - natural beauty does not seem to have rubbed off on its inhabitants. In the end the most sympathetic characters are the minor ones encountered along the journey - Menzies and Axel in the bush and Horrie and Bess in their decrepit van."", ""I was recommended this by a cousin on my most recent visit to Oz. I've never got out west but Tim Winton's powerful description of the Australian landscape is truly impressive - he captures superbly the epic quality of the vast coastline, the extraordinary scale of the land and the far horizons my mother still misses after so many years in the UK. The characters in the novel are not immediately sympathetic; drifters, deadbeats, the sad, lonely, addicted and crushed. From such unlikely material he creats a powerful narrative that becomes compelling. It is worth sticking with the novel through the rather shapeless middle. My only criticisms are that the character Jim Buckridge lacks depth and it is hard to see what is driving him to seek to recover Luther Fox from his northern exile as a part of some sort of penitential act to redress largely unspecified past wrongs. I also find it unlikely that an autodidact such as Luther would ever travel so far without at least one good book!

A shame as the first few chapters are a good inversion of the usual whodunnit. We know who done it from page one so the rest of the book is more intrigue about the ever changing context to the death. Espinosa is an interesting character though hardly fleshed out. He buys books in secondhand bookshops but we never really get to explore why or what this means to him. Much seems like characterisation but mostly superficially. Also as Rio is a city of extremes, we don't really get much more than a flavour rather than Espinosa understanding of those extremes. Rio's rich culture is also superficial with some trite comments and one liners on the situation of the poor population there.Women in the book do not escape stereotypes - beautiful and intelligent, beautiful and emotional and so on. Espinosa cant help but reflect on their looks and charms. In the end, when Rose the secretary has to escape the kidnapper, the solution is just plain offensive, absurd and wholly unrealistic for a woman in her predicament. Garcia Roza can't help but mix up her fear and danger with lame eroticism. Seems implausible."", 'Inspector Espinosa is an engaging detective. He considers himself incapable of ""sustained rational thought,"" yet he bears the same name as the great rationalist philosopher ( Spinoza in Portuguese becomes Espinosa). He\'s not corrupt, which makes him a misfit in the police force. His apartment is clogged with books, and he has no bookshelves, which puts him in constant conflict with his cleaning lady. He lives on Big Macs, milkshakes and frozen dinners, because he\'s divorced and alone. And he admires Melville\'s Bartleby the Scrivener -- a do-nothing character who makes an incongruous hero for a cop.The plot gets off to an odd start. In the first pages a we watch an executive disguise his suicide as murder.  But since Espinosa does not share the reader\'s knowledge, he spends most of the book trying to solve a murder that isn\'t a murder. But as he widens his investigation, key people disappear and real murders occur, which puts the inspector into a state of total confusion. He can only form fantasies about what \'s going on, but his fantasies are all wrong.It\'s rare to see so much floundering by the detective-hero in a police procedural, but Espinosa is such an appealing character that I forgave him all his mistakes. I even forgave his inappropriate attraction to certain women characters in the story.The plot offers both inaction and action in generous doses. Tedious stake-outs and exciting shoot-outs. And some fascinating scenes of love-making. The denouement is ironic and unforgettable. I loved it.So I enjoyed this book immensely, even though the detective wasn\'t always brilliant. For one thing, the writing style is superlative -- rich in humor and literary finesse. And the setting in Rio is fun, for different reasons than you might expect.

The novel moved along rapidly and the plot resolved itself logically.Those looking for a polite mystery may find this book gratuitously sensual and violent.I found the primitivity added authenticity.

Let's take a lesson from historical fiction and true account books  🙏"", '***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD***Let me share a fact today, I am attracted to tragedy and I found this out recently. I can not get over war-based historical fiction. I tried, but eventually, between other books of different genres, this genre keeps coming back to me, and I am helpless at stopping it. The tragedy in them excites me and the hope in them soothes my nerves.The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah is a tale of love and hate, bravery and fear, victory and loss, and much more, stories that are woven by the women of Occupied France.Vianne and Isabelle Rossignol had never been the sisters their mother had wanted them to be. In fact, they were more away than together. Ever since their beloved mother had died, they had been on their own. Facing abandonment from their Great War veteran father, they found themselves coping with their grief all alone. Neither could comfort the other in their time of shared misery. How could they? A 4-year-old and a 14-year-old hardly have anything in common. When each knew they had nobody but themselves, they looked for whatever could give them comfort and the love that had suddenly disappeared from their lives. While Vianne found herself deeply in love with Antoine, Isabelle was left fending for herself in boarding schools, which she was repeatedly expelled from because of her impetuous nature. Their father remained colder than the winters that befell France.When the war arrived and the French found themselves under German occupation, Vianne and Isabelle found themselves under the same roof, and yet at the opposing ends of fact and action, like always. Becoming a revolutionary came as second nature to Isabelle, and Vianne, well, she was left to host a German Captain in her large house and just try to survive with her little girl Sophie, waiting and hoping that Antoine would come back soon. As Isabelle’s risk-taking grew, so did her strained relationship with her father who didn’t want her in Paris again. With the danger increasing with every passing day, Vianne and Isabelle found themselves in situations where they had to choose their steps wisely, thinking not about the ones they love but save their own necks and making the right decisions while remaining true to their morales.Never were they prepared for what they faced, and never in their wildest dreams did they think things would come to what they did.Ah, what a beauty! What a beauty! I’ve read a few books on WWII but none brings out the lives of women as this book does. I am sure there must be other greater books than this one, but this was my first brush with the lives of women during the war, so my review might sound biased to some. This definitely isn’t going to be the last and you can rest assured, as am I, that I only have forward to look to.The narrative was lucid and smooth, though I wouldn’t say it was one of the best that I’ve read. There was surely a lack of art and beauty in the prose, it was just simple storytelling, in simple plain words. The characters were limited, a handful of them kept pace throughout while others had reappearances at apt places. Parallel stories ran through, and what struck me most amongst the multiple storylines was the desire to survive, against anything, at all costs, for the loved ones with them and back home. The reckless Isabelle with her adamant nature and the dependent Vianne took most of the space and formed the stories around them. The emotions were displayed beautifully. The lovestruck Isabelle and her anger towards her lover, her steel resolve to help her country thwart the Germans, the pining Vianne and her dilemma at having been at the edge with Beck, at having to make a decision between her honor and her children’s safety, Julien’s regret as an incapable father to his girls and his sacrifice for them, Rachael’s heartbreaking decision to leave her toddler in hope of a better life for him, Sophie’s coming of age when her best friend is killed and having to deal with the repercussions of being a growing child in the time of war...the list is endless. I can’t even begin to fathom how difficult life must have been, how did they find the courage to deal with everyday atrocities, how did they find strength, both physical and mental to keep living on and on. A country of women, that was what it was. Restless, unsafe, and difficult. And women are what this book is about. Powerful, resilient, and survivors.Having said all of the above, I must also mention that the story wasn’t as real as it might have seemed at the first glance. It was a blend of realism and artistic liberties. Gender biases, cliches, coincidences, Isabelle’s love story, and a lot of other things were put together to churn out a piece that would go on to become a bestseller. In the end, someone who hasn’t lived during the time isn’t expected to do all the justice when writing such books and some forgiveness can be granted, right? At least I can. Do I recommend this book? Hell yes. Do I need to critique it for all the faults that it had?

'Muckle Flugga' Off Nth coast of Shetland Islands.2. 'Eilean Mor' Flannan Islands, Off Scottish West Coast. Sometime around 15th December 1900, all three Lighthouse Keepers vanished without trace. The next three, are said to have completed their turn of duty on the remote Station, then all three resigned the Service, and each refused to explain why.3. 'Dubh Artach', also off the Western Scottish Coast, but well out into the Atlantic.For various reasons, nearly all have one or more unique features or histories. The Rock or 'Sea washed' locations are known for the sea's ability to climb their walls, such as Wolf Rock - which even howls its name.In my home town of Fleetwood UK, we even have three Lighthouses, although Local Authorities have allowed one of them to simply rot and partially collapse. Yet nobody will claim ownership, which may allow some remedial action.I would heartily recommend this book and the study of 'Pharology' to anyone, of any age.Jack D. Harrison"", 'I chose to read this book because I would love to live in a lighthouse. I’ve been fascinated with them since I was a child. I have no idea why. I really enjoyed this book. Stargazing is fascinating, funny and sad at the same time. It’s sad that the way of life the author is introduced to for six months is gone, just a distant memory. It’s just one of the victims of technology and advancement. Lighthousekeeping is not the only profession and way of life to have been altered or removed entirely. This is a profoundly sad book especially towards the end. I enjoyed every word, though. My obsession and fascination with lighthouses hasn’t waned.', ""Peter Hill's recollections of a summer as a young lighthouse keeper range from funny and thoughtful to the slightly crass and uninteresting. His descriptions of fellow keepers he met along the way are colourful and amusing - to the extent at which I felt sad when certain keepers left to be replaced by new ones with different traits and personalities. That was where the book felt strongest, in bringing these people back to life, and to give some impression of what two weeks in their company may have felt like. The dialogue and conversations are pretty strong, though feel fictitious - as are the moments where he remembers thinking something particularly deep and philosophical at certain points on his journey (though I can't begrudge this fully as the author would have to be blessed with a miraculous memory). The fact that some artistic license has been given in these cases isn't necessarily a bad thing however, as they convey feeling and stories.Where the book does become a bit plodding in my opinion is in the constant - and I mean constant - references to various and often obscure 70's musicians. This feels less like a tool for bringing us into the sphere of the time period and more of a way for the author to crowbar in his personal taste in music. The music he mentions is right up my street, and even then it started to get a bit tiring even after 30 or so pages. It has the potential for alienating readers for whom the references may mean nothing.The running themes of Watergate and the Vietnam War give a flavour of the time, but they feel slightly superficial and lack much rumination other than that the future didn't seem certain. I'm in no doubt that's how it may have felt at the time, but the book could have done a better job of putting younger readers like myself in that mood of uncertainty. The prose is fairly ordinary, which isn't always a bad thing, but given the subject-matter and the author's artistic leanings it definitely could have been more lyrical and poetic.The best parts of the book are definitely his 2am conversations with other keepers who tell stories of barmy souls and suicides, not least the escapades of this fascinating 'Lachlan Fairbairn' character, who seems worthy of a book all to himself.Overall, it is a fascinating and candid look into a world that is no more. A good research book for anyone wishing to write a book/film about a lighthouse, as it goes into good detail about the daily routine etc. It's written in an easy-going sort of way, and I can genuinely say I've never read a book where the pages just seem to melt away, and after spending ten minutes reading you suddenly realise it's been 2 hours and you're already 250 pages in.However, a surfeit of pop-culture references and occasional mis-steps (the lighthouse/penis comparison was a particular low point) do sadly bring this book down.""]";Stargazing.

But its self-reflexivity and constant collapsing into internal micro-narratives mirroring and obscurely commenting on the wider textual framework takes a lot of hard decoding. Since it is the very undecidability and unknowability of outcomes, the absence of any teleological take on events, that characterise the narrative’s ‘development’, that decoding becomes so much more challenging. No ‘meaning’ is apparent; there is no closure to the end of the novel. It just hangs there, winking and nudging at something significant at the auction, but defiantly thwarting resolution.Pynchon’s intention is to destabilise certainty. The next clue in the mystery about the stamp collection isn’t a clue at all but just another Inverarity obsession, a hint that a Place called Nowhere is a parody, like the whole book, of anything we might, as reasonable readers, call meaning. Pynchon himself said: “If you can get people to ask the wrong questions, you don’t have to worry about the answers.” So farewell postmodern angst, and welcome the free-flowing disconnects that impel Oedipa’s curiosity. None of it is really meant to mean or matter very much.']";Suffused with rich satire, chaotic brilliance, verbal turbulence and wild humour, The Crying of Lot 49 opens as Oedipa Maas discovers that she haas been made executrix of a former lover's estate.

It was a delicious no nonsense fast paced cop thriller/killer.  While I won\'t reiterate the book\'s storyline as you can find that in many other reviews, I will say I was delighted to find another writer that I could add to my ""must read"" list.It seems Shane, the protagonist of this story, appears in other Cannell novels, and he\'s as good as any I\'ve read.  He\'s gritty, full of human foibles and just like life, he doesn\'t always come out on the other side unscathed.  In Vertical Coffin, Shane gets the job of re-investigating the murder of a Sheriff\'s deputy who takes a bullet in the doorway (vertical coffin) of a home while serving a warrant.  During this riveting ride through the alaphabet soup of ATF, LAPD, LASD, IAD, SRT, SEB, etc. we follow Shane as he starts at the beginning, the way he was taught by Jigsaw John, following the evidence trail.  His temprorary partner, a good looking blonde named Jo, fights him most of the way.  Finally, Jo, who hasn\'t worked many homicides but has good instincts, decides to follow Shane\'s lead.As they make their way through the rubble of the first crime scene, a burnt out house; and through the rubble of life, they begin to trust each other and earn each other\'s respect.  This leads them to discover that the perp isn\'t dead and puts them on the roller coaster ride that can only end in death, destruction, pain, and victory for many of the players. And, believe me, there are a lot of players in this novel. You\'ll have to read this thriller to find out who dies, who\'s wounded and how coming out on the other side isn\'t always the best deal.  Cannell has a fine ear for gritty dialgoue and plot twisters.  Never knowing exactly where you\'re headed, you\'ll follow Shane through a fast paced storyline full of flesh outed characters, family dynamics, and enough plot twists to keep you on edge. You won\'t want to put this one down til you know how it ends and yet you\'ll also not want it to end.  As in real life, solving the case doesn\'t always bring a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction but it can bring growth and reflection.

The shooter then barracades himself inside his house and using an AK-47 takes on the Sheriff Department's SWAT along with an ATF SWAT team that arrives on the scene. During a ferocious gun battle, the ATF fires hot gas grenades into the house and it catches on fire which quickly turns into an inferno and then a bunch of massive explosions as weapons and other material in the garage are touched off. End of gun fight.LAPD officer Shane Scully finds himself in the middle of the matter as he has heard the transmissions about the officer being shot and believes it is a friend of his. He was right.

DNA evidence makes it a perfect match with the shooter.With that aspect of the case closed, recriminations start to fly about what ATF was doing on the scene and why they fired hot gas into the house, endangering the entire neighborhood. It is then discovered that ATF had asked the Sherrif's Department to serve the warrant and didn't advise of the extent of their suspicions about the type of person that was being served.Things go from bad to badder after the funeral of the deputy when the two SWAT teams end up in the same bar with predictable results.Shortly thereafter, one of the ATF officers is shot by a sniper.The evidence begins to pile up indicating a SWAT Unit War and Scully as neither ATF or SD is asked to investigate the matter by the Mayor and get to the bottom of who is doing what.The answer will astound you and I'm not going to give it away.

While there are some interesting stories from Hinduism in the book (like Yama\'s birth, the god of Death), I would NOT recommend this for those totally new to Hinduism, they\'re going to be horribly lost is my impression with the book. Definitely more for intermediate-advanced students/followers of Hinduism who have at least a basic pre-established vocabulary for Hinduism5. There\'s a LOT about Buddhism and Buddhas in the book.

I am quite positive you wouldn\'t regret it.', ""Edition anglaise de bien meilleure qualité que la française.Je ne m'en lasse pas"", ""Angel Sanctuary is interesting, that's for sure.This story is entertaining.  While it doesn't really make much sense, it still keeps you flipping pages, trying to figure everything out.  The cast is VERY large, and filled with very odd, and at times over the top characters.  The art is beautiful, with flowing hair, and detailed costumes.  Pretty much everyone is drawn pretty, which can make figuring out specific characters' genders difficult, but that actually adds to the quirkiness of the story.  I can see the roots of a very enthralling, epic drama in this volume, and I have to admit, I quickly bought volume 2 once I finished.The series can also be surprisingly gruesome when it wants to be, although it never dwells on the violence and gore, it also never holds back when it's needed.  From what I've read of Kaori Yuki, she is not afraid of letting her stories get dark, and they are all the better for it.  The story is also not afraid to delve into a little taboo melodrama, with a Flowers in the Attic level brother/sister romance at the center of everything.  Everything feels just dirty enough to make things interesting, but it keeps from crossing that line that would make the reader want to take a shower after reading it.There are issues, however.  The first, and biggest in my book, is the panel layout.  While it does improve as the book goes on, the panel layout is, at times, a complete and total mess.  Images are cramped, characters are hard to make out, and scenes have a very poor flow from panel to panel.  While things did settle, especially towards the later chapters, the poor layout decisions nearly make the first part of this volume impossible to read.Another issues is the sheer amount of information the reader is given, and at a rapid pace.  This book is about 80% info dump, which does free up the later chapters to focus more on progressing the plot, and develop the characters, but that earlier info dump can be pretty confusing.Still, the story is interesting, and at times very gruesome.  The shojo art hides a shonen story, and in turn it creates a series that could be easily enjoyed by both male and female readers.

A must read', 'I met the author of this book on Facebook a few months back, and he suggested this book to me. Since the publishers were Fingerprint, one of my favorite publishers, and the blurb planted seeds of intrigue in my mind immediately, I decided to give this book a go.After I finished reading the first chapter, which is a dream, I was confused. If the dream was from the girl’s POV, how could the feelings of the boy be shown (the excitement between the legs, etc.)? That seemed like an error. But even after that, throughout the story, the author does do head hopping quite frequently. I can understand that the author has used the ‘Third Person Omniscient’ technique, wherein the narrator is the all-knowing entity, but this narration technique is not recommended nowadays as it tends to involve head hopping (multiple POV’s in a single scene), which makes the read confusing as the reader gets to know the thoughts of all characters in a scene instead of just a single narrator. Also, there are too many long blocks of telling in the narrative instead of showing, which again violates the show-don’t-tell rule. It requires a lot of hard work to weave small blocks of telling into a scene, which the author didn’t do consistently. But of course, these minor technical glitches can be forgiven as he is just a debut author. With experience, he will improve.Although veiled by a sense of mystery, a good part of the story is an ordinary campus romance. The narration, though, is good enough to make you keep turning the pages. However, I didn’t like the way the boy, without even trying to be friends, directly proposes to the girl. It seemed too forced and unnatural. But once their friendship began, things settled down for good. Since I’m not quite good as far as prediction goes, almost all the plot twists were surprising to me. The language is very good; the sentences are quite poetic at places, and the overall editing is also tight, as expected from a Fingerprint book. However, it felt strange to spot a few spelling and punctuation errors here and there, a rarity in other Fingerprint books. At one place, ‘clam’ is written instead of ‘calm’, and I noticed a few punctuation errors, especially at the end of dialogues that are followed by an action. A period should be used instead of a comma in those cases. I think the blame falls on both the author and the editor. Also, the language sometimes bordered on casual (too many f-words and colloquial lingo) to flowery (sometimes overly complicated words pop up in an otherwise simple sentence, breaking the flow). But I am nitpicking here; overall the language is satisfactory.Some quotes are very good, especially this one: ‘Isn’t love the best festival that life celebrates?’. I liked these occasional philosophical touches that the author flavors the story with.The characterization of both the characters is quite good. The back stories are good, and their complex relationships with their families are written with a rare eloquence. Although the story could never pull my heartstrings enough to make me cry, I could feel for the characters throughout. Till the ending of the story, I was immersed in the story, the plot twists plunging me into a sea of intrigue. But alas, then came the ending, throwing me down a cliff of disappointment. It is really weird and unbelievable, throwing black ink over an otherwise well-weaved story. Although it is a fictional book, yet only if the story is a reflection of reality does it become more relatable to readers. In that aspect, the ending, in my humble opinion, totally fails.Be that as it may, this book is still a good one time read. I would rate it 3.3 stars out of 5. The author is talented, and I’m sure that in his next book, he will give me lesser reasons to complain and snatch a better rating from me.', '""A promise mad when in love, is the strongest one.""🧡* Book Review* 🔻A thousand times over - by Sudhanshu Bisen.•The cover of the book is simple, and the length is about 220 pages, so it is a light read.• I do not like the romance novels much but after reading the \' A thousand times over \' i think i am going to read romantic more often.

At first I wondered if The Night Visitor would live up to that standard. It certainly does!Unlike so many contemporary crime writers, Lucy Atkins writes beautifully. She has a natural feel for authentic dialogue, and the backcloth to the action is strongly atmospheric, here ranging from large public occasions, group gatherings and isolated scenes raising tension through a powerful sense of claustrophobia .After a relatively quiet opening, full of hints of what is to come, the tension rises steadily until the convincing, but by no means predictable denoument . Even without the increasing suspense and some powerful incidents, the book is compelling. The characters are distinctive and sharply defined and their relationships are fascinating in themselves. It is here in particular that I would place Lucy Atkins in the same bracket as LisaJewell, who strikes me as the finest writer of psychological thrillers that I have yet encountered. Both bring to their work a literary skill and emotional intelligence rarely found.  In addition neither rely on gratuitous violence, nor melodrama for their effects. In both writers we find a subtlety that is usually far more gripping and often chilling.', 'I liked this book.Olivia Sweetman is a professor of history, a minor celebrity as a TV historian, of the well-off, slightly spoilt middle class media persona type.  She is married with three children, and a husband who is also a minor celebrity thanks to a book he published several years before.  Her own book, much celebrated even before publication, is about to hit the stands and is expected to be a runaway success.  But Olivia has a secret that could destroy her reputation if it ever gets out.  But keeping it could destroy her own sanity.  She has a choice to make, and this book tells the story of how far Olivia will go to save herself.I have to say I did not like Olivia.

Given Gupta's high status as McKinsey's MD and his directorships of major American companies including Proctor & Gamble, and a leading investment bank namely, Goldman Sachs, Gupta should have never spoken to Rajaratnam, not even on the weather in Manhattan. But after his two successful terms as McKinsey's MD and when he was continuing to work for McKinsey as a partner, Gupta chose to do business with Rajaratnam in his personal capacity as an investor and potential joint-sponsor of an equity fund.What followed is a tragic story of what greed can do to an exceptionally high achiever and otherwise an intelligent, mature and level-headed person. As a convicted person, it has wiped out forever Gupta's credibility built over a 30-year, highly successful career with McKinsey. After two separate trials, Rajaratnam was sentenced for managing a fund that consistently out-performed the market because of insider trading, to 11 years in prison with a penalty, which he more than deserved. Gupta was sentenced to 2 years in prison with a US$5 million penalty. Moreover, SEC fined him US$13.9 million. The quid pro quo for providing insider information by Gupta to Rajaratnam was not established during the trial but the presiding Judge did not believe that it mitigated gravity of the crime.The book sets out in detail blow-by-blow account of the case and investigations. Gupta appealed against his sentence but, given the wire-tap and irrefutable circumstantial evidences, it is unlikely that he will be exonerated of the charge of compromising his fiduciary responsibility to shareholders and providing to Rajaratnam material, non-public information on various companies' working results to which he was privy as an independent director.An honest person is one who chooses to remain honest even when he is sure that there is no possibility of his being caught if he were to act dishonestly and benefit by it. Very sadly, inspite of his high academic qualifications, outstanding success in professional life and very comfortable financial position, Gupta failed that litmus test. By yielding to greed, he got himself involved with a seasoned crook like Rajaratnam and has paid a terrible price for it. Gupta cannot claim that he did not see through Rajaratnam. In the process, he has also sullied the image of well-educated and successful Indian community in the USA and given reason to Americans and other westerners to believe that Indians in general and even in high positions are not honest and trustworthy.The book is a good reading material for all those who are interested in the financial markets as also those who want to get rich quickly by playing the stock markets or those who are currently engaged in insider trading and absolutely confident that they will never be caught."", ""This is a well-written book and worth reading. The author does a very good job of portraying the main characters and their motivations. Also at certain points, ambivalence in her own mind about their actions comes across quite fine. A good read and worth slowing down in places to ponder where people make wrong choices ...This is a book more about Galleon & Raj Rajaratnam than about Rajat Gupta. For someone of his stature, Gupta comes across as a relative poor judge of people, blithely avoiding the use of advisors / counsel in doing basic DD and keeping his interests and arrangements free of conflicts. Rajaratnam is portrayed as charming but ultimately a schemer manipulating people's weaknesses.The case against Rajat Gupta did not come across well enough. There is very little specific information that ties in Gupta like how Kumar was tied in to the case. And for someone looking for an answer of whether Gupta did or did not engage in insider trading, the guilty verdict came across as being reached with some extrapolation of circumstantial facts. In all this, somehow yet again vampire squid managed to stay clean (evidence relating to David Loeb was not admitted in court) and left me more questions.While I have no sympathies for Gupta, I did feel a bit for him. He was perhaps a victim of a hyper-aggressive SEC and the Govt trying to snatch some prey after the biggies got away. Search of justice in American law comes across more often as personality led and more a grab for limelight and career than true justice. This seems true in this story as well and the book falls short here in addressing if Gupta's verdict could have been a possible outcome of such a game."", ""After reading this book, I am impressed about the author's research skills. The author has given importance to unexpected moments which completes the scene. It's a good book to read if you are interested in knowing about insider trading, hedge fund's manipulations, billionaire's supremacy, and of course about Rajat Gupta. My only concern about this book is, this book has too many details which makes the reader uncomfortable after some time forcing the reader to take a break.

Rice\'s plot has some raw promise, but it\'s quickly squandered by the dull characters and meandering, bizarre plot. It would take all of a genii\'s power to give some life to this story.A genii arrives at a man\'s house one night, and relates the story of his life (and afterlife), and a weird tale it is too. Azriel was a young Jewish boy in Babylon, who had the unusual gift of being able to talk to the god Marduk.He permitted himself to be turned into a living gold statue, a human sacrifice for the sake of the Jews -- but things go horribly wrong when an old witch curses and murders him. Now he is no longer human, but a powerful spirit that isn\'t an angel or a demon.Azriel spends centuries sleeping inside his own gold-encrusted bones, occasionally getting woken up to do something for his masters. Then he\'s suddenly out and about -- and there\'s no master. He witnesses the murder of a young girl, who recognizes him as ""the Servant of the Bones."" The angry Azriel is determined to unravel the mystery of why the girl was murdered.""Servant of the Bones"" follows the format of the Vampire Chronicles: an incredibly attractive immortal relates his life story to a listener (who, oddly enough, never seems to need the bathroom during the long oral bio). But the grandeur and richness of her other writings is missing here.Rice seems to be aware that her plot is too short and thin to be an entire novel. So she stretches it with lots of filler -- current events (no Bill-Clinton worship, please), her late husband\'s incomprehensible poetry, and endless descriptions of Azriel\'s skin, hair and eyes. Her usually colorful, sensuous prose is weirdly lifeless and dull here. And the plot is glacially slow.Most strangely of all, Rice starts playing fast and loose with religion and history. And devout followers of Judaism will probably be grinding their teeth: the faithful are shown as self-righteous, slobbering fanatics, while the hero worships other gods and shares prostitutes with his dad. She bangs readers over the head with her assertions that there were many versions of the Old Testament. And Rice tries to bring Azriel to the present by a story-line about terrorists, murder and a cult, but the present-day story-line feels tacked-on. It\'s like a supernatural Bond flick.But it doesn\'t exactly help that Azriel is not a terribly interesting character at all. Over the centuries he never develops a personality, and his actions seem pretty random. Why is he so besotted with Esther? We never know. The villain is cookie-cutter, and most of the supporting characters (including the narrator) are utterly forgettable.This story is a complete misfire for Rice, and a bewildering squandering of her talents. Her dull characters and weird views on Old Testament history are only a few of the problems in the turgid, colorless ""Servant of the Bones.""', 'A****', 'A great read at a wonderful value, delivered promptly and in good condition.']";In a new and major novel, the creator of fantastic universes of vampires and witches takes us now into the world of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the destruction of Solomon's Temple, to tell the story of Azriel, Servant of the Bones.He is ghost, genii, demon, angel--pure spirit made visible. He pours his heart out to us as he journeys from an ancient Babylon of royal plottings and religious upheavals to Europe of the Black Death and on to the modern world.

That's fine if we only live in such groups, but we don't. The evolution of technology has far surpassed anything our instinctive minds can keep up with, so much so that the world we know live in is rather different to what our natural instincts are good at dealing with.The now interdependent and global world means that worldwide issues such as international trade, environment, ethics mean that we must think globally and universally to find global solutions.  That's not an easy thing to do. Not only is it against natural instincts but the problems are of such a complex nature, that the sifting through of endless information and arguments is a difficult task for anyone.In this book, Singer takes the key issues and presents the key arguments.He is constantly trying to reason out the right thing to do in an ethical and moral sense using succint and well thought out logic.Is the structure of the UN fair? What approaches can we use for the Environment? What about the WTO product versus process laws?  He explains the background to anything he talks about very well so one wouldn't any sort of esoteric knowledge to understand his points.  That really is the sign of a top intellectual, that they can take something complicated and explain it in simple terms. For this Singer must get top marks.  He gives interesting examples when explaining the background to his points and some of the problems the world has.  I know more about the ethics of Tuna fish catching and the reasons why the EU capitulated in its attempts to ban animal leg traps.I really have no doubt that it is important that we shift they way we think and realise we are part of one big species that has responsibility to each other.  As Singer mentions in the opening of his book,  it only takes 25 kilograms of Uranium or 8 Kilograms of plutonium to construct a rudiementary nuclear weapon - it really doesn't alot to reck irrevocable damage, suffering and hardship. Anyone with a moral whif in the body cannot deny it's time we started learning to live globally.  The problem is how to do we do that in a rational, reasoned way.  This is where Singer and this book comes in.It's extremly thought provoking, informative, educational - up there with the best I have read."", 'A must-read book if you are interested in issues of global ethics. Even more amazing when thinking that the book was written in 2002. Singer again. Fantastic.', ""This book follows the style that is typical of Peter Singer's other works. I found his thoughts on the United Nations to be the most thought provoking; however, as he has already dealt considerably with the obligations of the rich to the poor in his other books and articles - I think his effort would have been better spent if the entire book focused on the United Nations and organizations like the WTO and IMF and the World Bank.He goes on to spell out some concerns with the undemocratic nature of these organizations (with the UN, it's specifically the Security Council). However, I would like more time to be spent on why the undemocratic nature of these organizations is problematic.  (The US isn't completely democratic either - it's a constitutional republic with certain safeguards against the possibility of a tyranny of a majority.  The permanent seat-holders within the UN security council have a veto-power that is supposed to offer similar protections against misuses of democracy.  Often criticized, the US uses this veto power often to protect Israel - is this a defense of the undemocratic nature of the UN?  Or is this evidence of its corruption and ineffectiveness?)The book's focus is on two aspects of globalization: the obligation of wealthy individuals to poor ones, and the obligation of wealthy states to poor ones.  His feelings of ethical responsibility are derived from his consequentialist commitments as a utilitarian.  He arrives at his conclusions through his mind-numbingly logical arguments.  The clincher:  unlike other moral theorists, he practices what he preaches.  Peter Singer donates a substantial portion of his income towards charities and overseas-aid organizations.""]";"Known for his thinking on matters ranging from the treatment of animals to genetic screening, Peter Singer now turns his attention to the ethical issues surrounding globalization.

And beyond that, for some of the topics, the book offered background as to the origin of the particular qualities that made a thing ""BAD"". One example comes to mind, the chapter on the unoriginality of TV programming in the last few decades.On this subject the author\'s explanation was illuminating: television programming must match the advertising in intellectual level so as to make the ads combine and flow seamlessly into the content. The ads are the central purpose to which everything must conform; if ads are banal in order to push merchandise then programming will be banal, including what is called news programming.Another point of agreement with the author was his view of our formal education system. Bryan Caplan\'s book, The Case Against Education, points out many of the same flaws as this book does, although the two books differ as to what the problem is. Caplan believes language and humanities studies are unnecessary, while Fussell believes the problem is with business and education courses. In any event, aside from acting as a signal to employers that a graduate has conformed and endured, the American school system overall fails to deliver results for a sizable number of young people.Be aware that this book is personal opinion. It is opinionated but not surreal or aberrant, while leaving some of the judgments certainly open to debate. The tone is satirical (at least I took it to be so), and I think, despite its age, nails down a few crazy aspects of our culture, even today, quite well. I can imagine his thoughts if he could see the state of our country today.If you are easily offended, perhaps you should pass on this one, but if you can enjoy a good rant and even find some humor in it, then I recommend it to you. I give it 5 stars.', 'I have much enjoyed Fussell’s book about American soldiers in WWII, really like his style of writing. There are many amusing moments in this book, and it certainly gave me food for thought. It is also a self indulgent rant. Fussell comes across as a bit bitter and for someone so erudite with a very interesting life, I found that very sad. He absolutely hates reggae music for example - it’s the worst, so repetitive. If memory serves correctly, Pachelbel’s canon was another object of derision, and Ravel’s bolero. He is absolutely right about many things he deplores, and has every right to write the book he wants to write. I just felt it might have been more rewarding for author and readers with a little less vitriol and a bit more fun and tolerance.']";A satirical reference work identifies and stigmatizes various contemporary examples of public relations attempts to make unnecessary--or downright bad--products seem necessary, discussing banks, restaurants, and canned music  Read more

Informative and interesting. I work in both neuroscience and psychotherapy. Anyone training in counselling, psychology, child development or parenting must read it.', 'Most practical and useful point from the book: Most children are programmed by nature to develop optimally if we just put them in natural and normal environment.  Our frantic effort to ""enrich"" their lives with toys and scheduled programs and accelerated academic learning is a mis-read of the brain literature - particularly on rats whose brains got bigger in ""complex environments"".  What researchers called ""complex"" was a lab setting which was meant to simulate the ""natural habitat"" of rats.  It is also a misread of the brain research on Romanian orphans and other severely deprived children.  Severe deprivation - taking away normal and natural environment for young children - causes brain damage (but not irreversibly).  That does not mean we need to provide much more than ""normal"" or ""natural"" for the typical child.  As harsh as poverty might be, the vast majority of children raised in poverty can hardly be compared with the extreme case of state institutions.  For all of the points in the book, this one will stick with me for a LONG time.  I wish more of the book is about this.If you can put aside your objection (or boredom) with the sometimes tedious academic argumentation, I think you will find that there is a very hopeful message in this book.  Our brain is built very, very well by nature.  And nature provides, through environment and people, lots of opportunities for the brain to grow.  Brains can grow for a very long time - for most functions through at least teenage years, and lifelong for many others.  Damages to the brain can be reversed or repaired in a good number of instances.  The book debunks, in a credible way, the extreme versions of the early childhood myths - stemmed not from malice, but perhaps from zealous advocacy hoping to draw attention to early childhood by garnishing it with ""brain science"".  Advocates sometimes forget that you can win the battle and lose the war (for children).  When you say ""age 0 - 3"" is the MOST important years where investment is MOST important and after that the cost to recover is VERY high, you have at the same time over-promised your cause while undermined anyone who is serving children after the age 3.  But that shouldn\'t be surprising to anyone - when you get marketers and political spin involved in social cause, what else would you expect?Bruer is argumentative.  I didn\'t mind it, but I can see how some reviewers find it distracting.  It is true that he did not go in depth into non-brain research to examine other evidence in support of the ""important early years"" argument.  His primary task is to de-couple of the pseudo-link between brain science and present early education policy/rhetoric.  Charges that Bruer is ""partisan"" or ""conservative"" is unfounded.  Bruer, while not a neuroscientist himself, is a very respected and neutral figure in the scientific research community, albeit a vocal advocate for GOOD science.  He, as the president (for 30 years) of one of the largest non-government foundation who funds basic human development research, has the unique vantage point of seeing the forest past the trees and shadows.  One thing that makes him particularly argumentative, perhaps, is because the 0 - 3 myth undermines the work that the foundation had funded for many years - a big part of which is to support researchers who are seeking to help people learn at ANY age.As a faculty focused on early childhood, I don\'t mind Bruer\'s book one bit.  For me, it does not make early childhood ""less"" important, it just makes the REST of human life more hopeful - and offers a greater respect for the richness of science (and the ""slowness"" of science to tell us about how things work.)  Disclaimer: I have NEVER been directly or indirectly funded by this foundation.  However, I worked with researchers and faculty who were funded by it.  I know that Bruer is very well respected by these researchers - in a non-partisan, non-ideological way (unless you count science is an ideology).']";"Most parents today have accepted the message that the first three years of a baby's life determine whether or not the child will grow into a successful, thinking person. But is this powerful warning true? Do all the doors shut if baby's brain doesn't get just the right amount of stimulation during the first three years of life? Have discoveries from the new brain science really proved that parents are wholly responsible for their child's intellectual successes and failures alike? Are parents losing the ""brain wars""?

It\'s not written in an expected format of a novel - with only a story taking us through the journey. This entire book, based on the theme of romanticism, is interspersed with passages/sections of some bits and pieces (which I enjoyed) that may seem more apt for a non-fiction/self-help sort of book. Such treatment may impact your reading experience, positively or negatively, depending on your expectations from the book.Having said that, I certainly enjoyed Rabih\'s and Kirsten\'s relationship from Alain\'s vantage point. There have been so many moments in the book where I, literally, had to look up  and wonder at the intricacies of human relationships that the author has put in front of me so gracefully and poignantly through his well-rounded and witty sentences.With so much available to devour on the beginnings and endings of relationship, Alain\'s views on maintaining one remind us, humans, of the consequences of the over-critical and over-apathetic approach we, subconsciously, tend to save for our ""loved"" ones.The primary reason I\'d recommend this book to you is its relatability factor. As long as you\'re human and intend to maintain relationship with one, I don\'t see why and how this book won\'t impact you. Book\'s certain viewpoints may unsettle you or challenge your preset ideologies, but they surely make you rethink and recalibrate the doctrines and principles you\'ve been taught to follow through your entire life.With making it our life\'s impossible mission to change/improve other person, we are hardly left with any time to look at our own selves and realize the pain and trouble that we can be to others too. So, reading a book that primarily asks you to take ownership of your own behavior and its impact, and heed to other\'s and one\'s own needs in a much kinder way just act as a gentle guide to a better and, dare I say, perhaps, a slightly easier way of living.""We don\'t need to be constantly reasonable in order to have good relationships; all we need to have mastered is the occasional capacity to acknowledge with good grace that we may, in one or two areas, be somewhat insane.""- Alain de Botton', ""The author has beautifully given his honest views on the matters of love. It's a must read, will give you great insights on romantic relationships & how to go about them in our real lives."", 'Amazing book. Must read for developing broader sense of what a relationship is. It provides philosophical dimension to love and how love runs its course ... ups n downs ... n sometimes completely flat. The writer wants us to know that it’s completely normal to feel certain things in a relationship.

In this book he has focused on the life of a young Czech poet growing up in the War-stricken Bohemia. He engages with the readers and makes them follow the journey of the poet’s life by pages filled with exploration of both masculine and feminine desires. The robust masculine desires of the young, virgin poet is juxtaposed to the longing feminine desires of his ageing and lonely mother, and other women who are a representation of her. These very desires also account for the relationship between the mother and the poet who look at each other everyday and learn to negotiate their lives since the poet’s birth. As the poet grows up, we then follow his doubts concerning his masculine identity wherein he feels dubious of his “feminine features”. Interestingly, the author celebrates youth, its vitality and at the same time grieves its impermanence; similar to what Oscar Wilde had done in sketching Dorian Grey’s character. What I also liked about the book was its Marxist understanding of art, of society, and of love. Not only does the author harp on a Marxist ideology to imagine a society but also delineates its shortcomings and the consequences it can bear on one’s self. The author has frozen the story of the poet in youth because at the heart of this novel, the poet’s story is a smart, emotional biography of all the poets we have read and defined our own emotions and desires. It is a story that shows the erotic, ambitious, conflictual side of the poets which has often been cloaked by the beauty of their works. I cannot wait to read a book by Milan Kundera soon.', 'It can take a bit of time to get into the flow of the prose. Overall, I found it quite an interesting book to read. It explores various themes, issues and emotions such as adolescence, the changing dynamics in the relationship between mother and son, love, betrayal, romance, jealousy, living during the revolution era etc. Jaromil desperately wants his poetry work to get the recognition he believes it deserves. He is exasperated when the work that he pours his heart and soul into doesn’t win praises from the painter who he looks up to and is like a mentor to him, yet the work that he does half-heartedly on the other hand gets praised enthusiastically by the painter. He wants to be respected and highly regarded and be the centre of attention; he achieves this when he is basically parroting the insights the painter once said to him. Jaromil is an unlikeable protagonist. He comes across as a self-centred person. When he realises the gravity of his action of reporting the red-headed girl’s brother to the police, he is quick to banish away the feelings of guilt.', 'Not his best work but interesting perspective of his time, good for people that are not familiar with the mentality of this type of society']";A budding poet and his adoring mother are the central characters of this intriguing early novel by Milan Kundera.

But as always with Kundera it is the acute insights into our minds and hearts that make his work so powerful.

Very few books on writing are willing to confront  the darker side of trying to create: the monumental procrastination, the anxiety that arises at the thought of being completely authentic, and the day to day struggle to just ""show up"" and say yes, or no, to the creative process. Maisel treats artists and the creative process with deep respect, acknowledges what the struggle entails, and does not demean his readers by issuing false promises or platitudes.

Harlow's discovery of love in infant monkeys. Equally unforgivable is the neglect of the foundation of social bonding in attachment theory of John Bowlby.The outcome therefore is replication of 'selfish gene' or 'self interest' by thrusting 'non-zero-sumness' from cellular organelles to global organizations. Yet throughout the book NONZERO, most surprisingly, the author wonders to embrace Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: the noosphere, the Omega, the God.In this goal, the author begins with the biological evolution; where arguments become shaky Wright invokes cultural evolution; at places curious amalgam of gene-culture coevolution is applied. How biological and cultural streams meet remains an open question. However, Wright keeps students of animal behaviour and students of history busy in trying to understand each other!Does the author ultimately succeed in giving a new perspective on cooperation? On humanly bonds of love! The attempt is marvelous; the author questions the authority of God as reflexively as the authority of science. The twin beliefs needs to reconcile in good karma.

It is deeply inspiring and I feel like I learned a lot from it, it really stresses the importance of ensuring that everyone should be well and in an unbias manner regardless of their age, sex, ethnicity, and intelligence. A good read for anyone, lessons to be learnt for everyone', 'Focused on three liberating topics—not-learning, hopemongering, and creative maladjustment—Kohl’s collection of five engaging essays is the radical text that every passionate and well-intentioned pre-service teacher, in-service teacher, and teacher educator needs to read.Kohl is not at all concerned with knowledge and skills, although he does acknowledge the need for both of these elements in creating equitable learning opportunities for students. He concerns himself—and his teaching—with affect, dispositions, and creating mutually respectful and supportive relationships with students.He argues in favor of the romantic, power-giving aspirations of teachers and cleverly deconstructs the belief that students need to be educated for the “real world.” He reframes student behavior that is often considered oppositional and inappropriate as the only sensible reaction to an unjust and inequitable system, describing this response as intentional not-learning. He extols the virtues of hopemongering, which he views as necessary for true education in a democratic society. As he explains, “A decent world can only be made by people whose growth has not been stunted by the imperatives of others” (p. 88). His analysis of creative maladjustment offers wise advice to those “rebel” teachers who refuse to conform to oppressive and inequitable aspects of the public school system and shows that revolution against unfair practices is best achieved from within the system itself. The wisdom contained in these 153 pages is far more valuable than that which is found in any thick methods text.This book is, in short, the text I wish I had read when I started teaching. I will make it my mission to share it with every teacher candidate and colleague I know.', 'Why won\'t some children learn? This is the central question of Herbert Kohl\'s persuasive book that mixes together history lessons, philosophy and autobiography to produce an important contribution to the discussion of education reform.As a progressive educator of considerable foresight, Herb Kohl is aghast at the state of public education in America. He doesn\'t just rail against privatization, monocultural national standards or modern-day McCarthyism, he shares many colorful examples that put debates in education reform within a human context.Kohl\'s useful argument is that for many more children than we think, ""not learning"" is a form of resistance to oppressive or unsuitable teaching. This point is stressed again and again throughout his ""I won\'t learn from you"" and Other Thoughts on Creative Maladjustment.""Since students have no way to legitimately criticize the schooling they are subjected to or the people they are required to learn from, resistance and rebellion is stigmatized. The system\'s problem becomes the victim\'s problem. However, not-learning is a healthy, though frequently dysfunctional, response to racism, sexism and other forms of bias. In times of social movements for justice such refusal is often turned to more positive mass protest and demonstration and to the development of alternative learning situations."" (29)As an example, the author points to a Texas class in the late 1980s where he observed a teacher lecture Latino students on the first people to settle the region: New Englanders! Is it any wonder these children hate the books and teachers who systematically deny their heritage by claiming that white Europeans settled Texas first (not Native Americans, not Mexican-Americans)?Coming of age in the 1960s, Kohl\'s autobiographical inclusions are great reading. He discusses his upbringing in the Bronx (""a Jewish ghetto""); his introduction to radical trade unions, socialism and communism; anti-Semitism at Harvard; involvement in the deaf power movement (he was sharply criticized for suggesting people use sign language to communicate with the deaf, rather than force the deaf to lip-read and learn to speak!); teaching Black nationalist students and his run-ins with school authorities over his unconventional teaching methods.Kohl\'s chapter on political correctness is a must-read. He recalls the debates in the Bronx between socialists and communists, different generations of immigrants and above all, the terrible period of McCarthyism that personally affected the adults he knew. Referencing back and forth between this period and the present, Kohl savages right-wing forces that attempt to stifle progressive ideas at the University level and sabotage public education at the K-12 level.Above all else his ability to ground his ideas in the reality of the environment most teachers operate within (instead of the fantasy world found in some teacher\'s education books) make his observations useful for the teachers actually likely to encounter maladjusted students. In fact, Kohl\'s book ends with the argument for maladjustment. Teachers must misadjust themselves to bad teaching methods, cultural insensitivity and (he hints) even the profit system.I can take only two exceptions to this wonderful book. First, in recalling the painful period of his life around the Second World War, Kohl romanticizes emigration to Palestine and fails to challenge the racist myth of ""a land without a people..."" the way he encourages his readers to always do. This is really too bad considering his extraordinary empathy with people different from himself and his grasp of world history.Second, although Kohl does not explicitly say this, the reader can be left with the impression that the world can be made a better place through widespread, progressive education alone. No doubt an important step, yet this overstates the value of education. Can a good education alone erase class divide? Of course not, we cannot all be CEOs, generals or powerful politicians (nor should we want to!) This is a task that will have to be taken up by the children themselves who refuse to accept manifestations of racism, sexism and class in the world they inherit. Their struggle will be more than just educational.Parents, students, educators: Read this book, share it and draw inspiration from it in your own contest over the future of public education.']";"""I Won't Learn From You,"" Herb Kohl's now-classic essay on ""not learning,"" or refusing to learn, is available for the first time in an affordable paperback edition along with four other landmark essays. Drawing on an idea of Martin Luther King Jr.'s, Kohl argues for ""creative maladjustment"" in the classroom and anywhere else that students' intelligence, dignity, or integrity are compromised by a teacher, an institution, or a larger social mindset. This volume also includes ""The Tattooed Man,"" Kohl's autobiographical essay about ""hopemongering,"" which Kohl finds essential for all effective teaching in these difficult times.  Read more"
